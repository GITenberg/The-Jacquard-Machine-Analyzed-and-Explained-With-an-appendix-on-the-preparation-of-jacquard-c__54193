<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>Very little has been written upon the Jacquard machine, and the fabrics produced
by it; and nothing at all has been heretofore published in this country with
regard to the machines and systems, as employed here.</p>

<p>Greatly assisted by the guidance, help and advice of Mr. T. C. Search, President
of the Philadelphia Textile Association, and Vice-President and Chairman of the
Committee of Instruction of the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial
Art, the author gives here the results of his practical experience on this subject,
with a very detailed description of the methods of procedure with the Jacquard

<h2><a name="HISTORY_OF" id="HISTORY_OF"></a>HISTORY OF<br />
<span class="smcap">The Jacquard Machine</span>.</h2>


<p>The Jacquard machine was named after Joseph Marie Jacquard. Jacquard
was born in Lyons, France, on the 7th of July, 1752. His parents were employed
in the manufacture of silk fabrics. The first trade Jacquard learned was book-binding;
type-founding and cutlery following successively. He was 20 years of age
when his father died, leaving him a small house and hand-loom in the village of
Cauzon, near Lyons. He commenced to invent different improvements in the line
of weaving, but without other success than accumulating debt, compelling him to
earn the living for himself and family, first in a plaster quarry at Bugey, near Lyons,
afterwards by working at cutlery, type-founding and weaving in Lyons.</p>

<p>In 1792 he joined the Revolutionists, and after his return in the following year
he and his son assisted in the defence of Lyons against the Army of the Convention,
but left when his son was killed near him in battle.</p>

<p>Lyons Council offered him a room, for working on improvements for weaving at
the “Palace of the Fine Arts,” with the condition that he should instruct scholars free
of charge. During his stay there the Society of Arts, in London, offered a reward for
a machine for making fishing nets. Jacquard succeeded in perfecting it, but had to
travel under protection to Paris, where he had to show and explain his machine
before the “Conservatorium of Arts and Trades.”</p>

<p>On the 2d of February, 1804, Jacquard received 3000 francs, and the gold
medal from the London Society, and also an engagement in the Conservatorium of
Arts, in Paris. Here he found opportunity for making improvements on his
weaving machine, by the study of the older inventions of Bouchon, Falcon and
Vancanson.</p>

<p>M. Bouchon, in 1725, employed a band of pierced paper pressed by a hand-bar
against a row of horizontal wires, so as to push forward those which happened to lie
opposite the blank spaces, and thus bring loops at the lower extremity of vertical
wires in connection with a comb-like rack below. M. Falcon submitted in 1728 a
chain of cards, and a square prism, known as the cylinder, in lieu of the band of
paper of Bouchon. In 1745, Jacques de Vancanson suppressed altogether the
cumbrous tail-cards of the draw-loom, and made the loom completely self-acting
by placing the pierced paper or card upon the surface of a large pierced cylinder,
which traveled backwards and forwards at each stroke, and revolved through a small
angle by ratchet work. He also invented the rising and falling griffe, and thus
made a machine very nearly resembling the actual Jacquard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>Jacquard returned to Lyons in the year 1804 to take charge of the work-house.
During his stay at this place he finished his machine. He was an experienced
workman, combining together the best parts of the machines of his predecessors in
the same line, and succeeded as <i>the first person</i> in obtaining an arrangement
sufficiently practical to be generally employed. In 1806 Napoleon Buonaparte
changed his position, giving him an annuity of 3000 francs, but compelling him to
transfer his invention to the city of Lyons, as well as any further inventions. Until
1810 Jacquard had great troubles, as his machine was not understood by the weavers.
So violent was the opposition made to its introduction that he was compelled to leave
Lyons in order to save his life. The <i>Conseil des Prudhommes</i> broke up his machines
in the public places, and Jacquard was delivered over to universal ignominy. But
after some years had passed the machine proved to be of the greatest value, and on
the spot where the model was destroyed a statue to Jacquard now stands. He died
August 7th, 1834, in Quillins, near Lyons, at 82 years of age. At the time of his
death over 30,000 Jacquard machines were in operation in his native city.</p>

<h2><a name="The_JM_General_Arrangement" id="The_JM_General_Arrangement"></a>The Jacquard Machine.&mdash;General Arrangement
and
Application.</h2>


<p>If a fabric contains a great number of ends of warp bound differently in the
filling, the method of guiding the warp by harness frames is too cumbrous and
inefficient; in such cases it becomes necessary to use the Jacquard machine for
raising the warp-threads separately by means of hook and leash.</p>

<p>The hooks as used for raising leash, mail, lingo, and warp-thread, consist of
wires 16 to 17 inches long, with a crook on each end. On the lower crook is
fastened the leash by means of the neck-cord.</p>

<p>The cords of each leash are threaded through the holes of the comber-board;
the latter are separated from each other according to the texture of the warp in
reed.</p>

<p>On the harness-cords are adjusted the heddles, (either twine or wire), on which
are fastened the lingoes as weights. In the mails of the heddles are drawn the
warp-threads.</p>

<p>Now, from the foregoing explanations, it will be apparent that by raising the
hook in the Jacquard machine we raise the leash, and the latter raises every warp-thread
throughout the fabric for interlacing with the filling.</p>

<p>The next point required to be known is, which hooks are to be raised, and
which are to be lowered? To regulate this, a design (pattern) is prepared in which
the floating of the warp over the filling is indicated.</p>

<p>For the warp-threads required to be raised holes are punched in the cards. In
these holes the points of the needles extending through the needle-board are pushed
by a spring fastened on the rear of each needle. The needles are adjusted in rows
of different heights. The arrangements most used are 4, 8, and 12 rows high.
Each row as to height in the machine contains a bar (knife) in the griffe. When the
griffe is down, or the machine at rest, the upper crooks of the hooks are raised
about half an inch above the griffe-bars.</p>

<p>The needles which control the position of the hooks, permitting them to rise or
compelling them to remain stationary, are pressed by the springs fastened in the
rear towards the cards, which are moved on a quadrilateral and perforated cylinder.
This cylinder performs a movement similar to a pendulum towards the points of the
needles. Any needle for which a hole was punched in the card will penetrate the
cylinder; consequently, the corresponding hook will remain in its natural position,
on the crook over the corresponding griffe-bar, and upon lifting the griffe the hook
will be raised.</p>

<p>Again, needles for which no holes are punched in the cards will be thrust back
by moving the cylinder containing the cards towards the needle-board; this motion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
forces back the corresponding hooks, pushing them away from the griffe-bars above,
and upon raising the griffe they will remain stationary; hence, if a blank card were
pressed against all the needles of any machine, the entire number of needles the
machine contains would be pushed back, and none of the hooks would come in
contact with the griffe-bars, and, consequently, raising the griffe would produce an
empty lift. On the other hand, using a card having every hole of the cylinder
punched, (or the empty cylinder used), would lift every needle in the machine.
Pressing the needles towards the rear compresses the springs; these will again
expand as soon as the cylinder leaves the needle-board. The hooks, which were left
standing in their position over the griffe-bars are caught by the latter at the raising
of the griffe. The elevation of these hooks raises the leashes fastened to them,
thus causing the lifted warp-threads to form a shed with those not lifted.</p>

<p>Jacquard machines are made of different sizes and descriptions, some having
only a few hooks and others a large number. The sizes most often used are 100,
200, 400, 600, 900, 1200 hooks. The number or size is always indicated by the
number of needles and hooks which it contains, without counting the reserve rows,
of which there are generally two. These reserve rows are used for various purposes,
such as raising the selvedge; raising the front harness; raising the shuttle-boxes on
hand-looms; guiding the take-up motion on hand-looms; indicating a certain card
through ringing a bell on hand-looms, etc.</p>

<p>Sometimes a few of the needles and hooks from the reserve are added to the
main part of the needles and hooks. For example: Take a design in which the
ground weave repeats on 12 ends; working a 400 machine, we find:</p>

<p class="center">400 ÷ 12 = 33 repeats of the weave, less 4 hooks;</p>

<p>Consequently, if this ground-weave is repeated all over the width of the fabric,
we must use either:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>396 hooks, leaving 4 hooks more to be added to the two rows already used; or 408 hooks,
requiring us to call upon the reserve rows for eight extra hooks.</p></blockquote>

<p>Hooks which have no leashes adjusted must be taken out of the machine.</p>

<p>Sometimes two, three, or more, machines are employed on one loom, and
may be worked in different manners. In this country Jacquard machines, for power
as well as hand-looms, are made of iron, whereas in Europe the machines for hand-looms
(comprising the greater part of the Jacquard machines in use) are made of
wood; using the iron ones only for power-looms; and even yet, in most cases, the
wooden machines are used for the latter.</p>

of the frame in its main part [see 6 to 7]
is 9-1/2 inches.</p>

<p>1-1/8 inches is the width of the iron casting

<h3>THE PERFORATED BOARD.</h3>

<p>This board is fastened by screws to the frame at places indicated in <a href="#FIGI">Fig. I.</a> by

<h3>THE PLUNGER.</h3>

<p>Besides the frame, <a href="#FIGI">Fig. I.</a> illustrates:
Under I. the Jacquard plunger,
3/4 inch diameter, for guiding the griffe
(attached to its head) when raising. To
strengthen the steadiness of this latter
movement shoulders are attached to the
frame at the three places where the
plunger slides.</p>

<table class="tablel" border="0"  summary="plunger frame" >
<tr><td class ="tdl2"> Height of frame at <i>k</i>,</td>
  <td class="tdl2"> = 2-3/4 inches.</td></tr>

  <td class="tdl2"> = 2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;inches.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="pclear">Screws, <i>f</i>, dotted in drawing, on head of plunger, fasten the griffe to it.</p>

<p>Part III. in <a href="#FIGI">Fig. I.</a> illustrates the attachment for providing the lifting of the
plunger in a hand-loom, likewise the griffe, etc. This consists of a triangular
shaped frame 14-1/4 inches high, or less, according to height of room. This part is
fastened to the front part of the frame by bolts at <i>o</i> and <i>p</i>. In the slot at the top,
between <i>r</i> and <i>s</i>, a wooden cylinder of 3-1/2 inches diameter is fastened to an iron
shaft resting in the frame at <i>t</i>.</p>

<p>At 13 a leather strap is fastened to this cylinder and to the plunger 14.
It will easily be seen that by turning the wooden cylinder in the direction of
the arrows, 15, the plunger will be raised with the griffe fastened to its top. By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
reversing the action of the cylinder, the plunger and griffe will return to their
previous positions. The action thus described constitutes a “single lift,” raising
and lowering of plunger and griffe for each pick.</p>


<h3>THE CATCHES.</h3>

<p>At IV., <a href="#FIGI">Fig. I.</a>, the “catches” for turning the cylinder at the lantern are illustrated.
The distance of the centre of the screws which hold the catches to the
frame is 4-3/4 inches. Between these two catches the cylinder is adjusted to the
batten, and the direction of its turning is regulated by the catch which is brought
in contact with the lantern. If the
catch, <i>y</i>, turns, the cylinder will turn
the card situated on its top towards
the needle-board, and if catch, <i>z</i>, is
brought into contact with the lantern,
the card hanging below the needle-board
will be the next in turn to be
pushed towards the needles.</p>

<p>The entire length of the
catches in the present illustration
is 8 ins., allowing 5-1/4 ins.
for the catch itself and 2-3/4 ins. for the part to which it is fastened. Making
this catch in two pieces is preferable to the old style of one piece, because
the moment of turning the cylinder can be more easily regulated.</p>


<h3>THE GRIFFE.</h3>

<p><a href="#FIGIII">Fig. III.</a> illustrates the top view of the griffe. As
mentioned before, the griffe is fastened to the plunger
by means of screws. In the drawing the dark shaded
places marked <i>f</i> are the hollow places in the griffe,
through which the screws fasten the latter to the plunger. The griffe, like the
other parts explained, is made of cast iron, and the machine is of the following
dimensions:</p>

<h3>THE NEEDLE.</h3>

<p><a href="#FIGVI">Fig. VI.</a> illustrates a needle, as used in connection with the hook. Distance
from head to loop, 9-1/8 inches, = <i>a</i> to <i>c</i>.
Length of loop, 1-5/8 inches, = <i>c</i> to <i>d</i>. 10-3/4
inches entire length.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. VI.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The distance from head to eye (for passing through the hook) is regulated
according to the row in which the needle belongs. In the present illustration this is,
Head to eye, = 7 inches, = <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>. The eye, = 3/8 inch, = <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>Eight different positions of the distance of the eye from head will be required
by an 8-row machine. The needles are made of No. 15-1/2 bright spring wire.
The loop on the end, <i>c</i> to <i>d</i>, permits a pin to be inserted, [see <a href="#FIGVII">Fig. VII</a>., <i>o</i>], and also
holds the needle in position.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 393px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. VII.</span></div>
</div>

<p><a href="#FIGCVII">Fig. VII</a>. gives a clear understanding of the arrangement of hooks, needles,
griffe-bars, springs, frame for holding the latter, and the needle-board. This drawing
is in accordance with the preceding
ones, executed one-fourth of the actual
size, and represents the sectional cut of one
cross-row in the Jacquard machine containing
8 hooks, (as it is an 8-row deep machine
which we explain): <i>e</i> to <i>e´</i>, 1st hook; <i>f</i> to
<i>f´</i>, 2d hook; <i>g</i> to <i>g´</i>, 3d hook; <i>h</i> to <i>h´</i>, 4th
hook; <i>i</i> to <i>i´</i>, 5th hook; <i>k</i> to <i>k´</i>, 6th hook;
<i>l</i> to <i>l´</i>, 7th hook; <i>m</i> to <i>m´</i>, 8th hook. These
hooks are held in their required places by
the eyes of the needles [see place <i>v</i> at hook
1], through which the former are passed.</p>

<p>The needles rest with their heads in
the needle-board, <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>, extending outside,
towards the cylinder, for about 1/2
inch. The rear part of the needle&mdash;the
loop&mdash;is passed between two bars of
the spring frame, <i>n</i>, <i>p</i>, and held by the
latter firmly, but with sufficient play for a
longitudinal motion for pressing towards
their springs. The pin, <i>o</i>, is inserted for
holding the springs in their places. One
pin is required for each vertical row of
needles. The part of the spring frame,
<i>r</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>s</i>, unshaded, is made of cast iron; the shaded part (extension) is constructed
of wood. Below the upper crook of the hooks, the black sections represent a sectional
cut of the griffe-bars; <i>v</i> to <i>w</i> indicates the rester for the lower hooks, which
keeps the latter in their required position.</p>

<p>A study of this illustration will show that when the heads of the needles, <i>a-b</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
are pushed backwards, in the direction of arrows, the hooks are also moved. If the
needles are not pushed, the upper crooks of the hooks will remain in position, as in
drawing, over the griffe-bar; and raising the latter will consequently raise every
one of these hooks. Therefore, if a blank card is pressed against the 208 needles
of the machine, all the needles and hooks will be pushed back, out of the way of
contact with the griffe-bars, thus causing an empty lift when they are raised;
whereas, by pressing with an empty cylinder, or with a card, containing as many
holes as the machine has needles, and so placed that the holes are exactly opposite
the needles, none of them would be moved, and each hook would remain vertical
over its griffe-bar; and raising the griffe will lift every hook.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, the springs, <i>u</i>, are attached to the needles between the
needle-frame, <i>n-p</i>, and the pin, <i>o</i>. <a href="#FIGVI">Fig. VI.</a>, the distance <i>e</i> to <i>f</i> indicates the part of
the loop around which the spring is adjusted, and where it rests against the
expansion of the loop. <i>f</i>, in <a href="#FIGVI">Fig. VI.</a>, represents the place where pin, <i>o</i>, (as shown
in <a href="#FIGVII">Fig. VII.</a>) passes through the loop and is fastened to the needle-frame on top and
bottom. Pressing the needle at the head compresses the spring, as the latter is
securely fastened on one end by the wider part of the loop, and on the other end
by a pin inserted in the loop and fastened to the frame. Remove the pressure at
the head of the needle, and the spring will return to its natural position, pushing
the needle into its old place. These springs are made of thin brass wire.</p>

<p>It is necessary to keep the needle-eyes in the proper place, otherwise it
would result in bending the hook out of its perpendicular position, and by
lowering the griffe its bars would possibly come in contact with the head of
the hook, crushing the latter, or doing more damage if not detected at once. Each
needle or hook, if worn out, can be replaced by pulling out the pin, <i>o</i>, thus loosening
the needle and giving a chance to work the required hook out of the needle-eye.</p>

[see No. 14, in <a href="#FIGI">Fig. I</a>.], and the
frame, [see No. 16, in <a href="#FIGI">Fig. I</a>.] The
batten, 2, is connected to a triangular
lever by means of lever, <i>d</i>. Another
vertical lever connects the lower part of
this triangular lever to a projecting bolt,
<i>k</i>, fixed to the guiding-rod of the griffe.
By raising the guiding-rod, thus raising lever, <i>k</i>, in the direction of the arrow, the
batten is thrown outwards, [see direction of arrow below <i>c</i>], returning again to its
former position at the lowering of the griffe. <i>f</i> indicates the place where the
triangular lever is fastened (movable) to the projecting bolt, extending out of the
frame. <i>a</i> indicates the place for the cylinder. Part 1 of the batten is movable at <i>l</i>
in the direction of arrow, <i>s</i>, allowing the cylinder to be inserted. Part 1 is fastened
(after putting the cylinder in at <i>a</i>), to 2 by means of the screw, <i>n</i>.</p>

<p class="pclear">This cylinder is carried in the batten, the latter moving in the groove provided
for it under 10, <a href="#FIGI">Fig. I.</a> This batten has sufficient vibratory motion to enable it
to move the required distance away from the needle-board. After coming in
contact with the catch it still moves until the cylinder has performed a complete

<p>As before mentioned, the heads of the needles are passed through the needle-board.
A drawing of this board, representing the front view, is shown in <a href="#FIGXI">Fig. XI.</a>
The following are the dimensions:</p>

<p class="in2"><i>a</i> to <i>c</i>, = 9-1/2 inches. <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>, = 2-3/8 inches.</p>

<p>Each side of the prism, always technically called
the cylinder, has a protruding peg about 1/2 inch
in length. When in contact with the needle-board these pegs enter the black holes
shown upon either side in drawing. The 208 needles and holes in the present machine
are represented by a small spot for the former with an outside ring for the latter.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">

</div>

<p>The lifting of the griffe, which in turn
also operates the other parts of the Jacquard
head, as explained before, is not
always produced from above: very often
this lifting is arranged to be done by means
of a lever arrangement from below the
griffe. This method of working the mechanism
in the Jacquard machine is illustrated
by <a href="#FIGXII">Fig. XII.</a>, representing the perspective
view of a 400 Jacquard machine, (W. P.
Uhlinger, builder).</p>

<p><a href="#FIGXIII">Fig. XIII.</a> represents the
same machine adjusted to
the loom. On the longer
arm of the lever a series of
holes are found. These
regulate the height of the
lift by the vertical rod
which provides the required
movement. The nearer this
rod is adjusted to the Jacquard
head the higher the
lift of the Jacquard harness,
thus forming the shed.</p>


<h3>THE JACQUARD CARDS.</h3>

<p><a href="#FIGXIV">Fig. XIV.</a> represents a
single Jacquard card, as required
for the 200 Jacquard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
machine, 1/4 of its actual size. This shows 26 rows of holes in its width and 8 rows
in its depth, 208 holes. These holes are shown in black, one for each hook in
the machine. Besides these a large hole on
each side permit the pegs of the cylinder to enter
into the needle-board. The cards are interlaced
in an endless arrangement.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="FIGXV" id="FIGXV"></a><img src="images/i_018a.jpg" width="300" height="145" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. XV.</span></div>
</div>

<p><a href="#FIGXV">Fig. XV.</a> illustrates four cards laced together.
The large holes (marked <i>d</i> in drawing) are peg holes to receive the pegs,
<i>h</i>, <i>h´</i>, <i>h´´</i>, <i>h´´´</i>, etc., of the cylinder, as shown in <a href="#FIGIX">Fig. IX.</a> These pegs are movable
so that any small variations at cutting with different card-stamping machines can be
rectified. The paper used for the cards
must be of sufficient thickness to resist
the wear caused by the needles, as well
as to give steadiness to the cards when
resting in the pegs of the cylinder.</p>

<p>The cards are interlaced in an
endless arrangement; hence, one card
is brought after the other in rotation
towards the needles. The cards only
refuse service by not fitting properly on the cylinder, <i>i. e.</i>, if the peg holes are too
near together or too far apart; or if the cards are warped, which is liable to happen
in a damp workshop.</p>

<p>A careful examination of the cards fitting on the cylinder is absolutely necessary,
otherwise a wrong lifting of the hooks destroying the cards by the pegs punching new
holes would result. The cylinder with cards perfectly cut must be set so as to allow
the needles to penetrate into the centre of the holes stamped for them in the card.
Sometimes the cylinder is set too high or too low&mdash;too far in front or too far in rear.
To ascertain the proper position, lift the machine and place some paint, or grease
from the machine, on the heads of the needles. Afterwards let the machine
“fall in,” which will bring the cards against the heads of the needles, producing
an impression and indicating the exact position of the needle-heads. The cylinder
is always set in its proper position when no marks
are made by the entering needles on the margins
of the stamped holes and where there are no
holes the impression left by the needle head must
be equally distant from the surrounding holes.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">

</div>

<p>To get a clear understanding of this examine
<a href="#FIGXVI">Fig. XVI.</a> illustrating six different impressions
of the needles. The circle shown with full lines
in each of these six illustrations represents the
correct position of the circumference of the hole,
and the dotted circles the various errors that may
exist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<ul class="nostyle">
<li><a href="#FIGXVI">Fig. A</a> shows the cylinder set in its proper place, which is indicated by the
impression of the needle in the centre.</li>

<li><a href="#FIGXVI">Fig. B</a> shows the cylinder is set too high, as indicated by the impression of the
needle. [See arrow.]</li>

<li>In <a href="#FIGXVI">Fig. C</a> the cylinder is set too low.</li>

<li>In <a href="#FIGXVI">Fig. D</a> the cylinder is set too far to the left.</li>

<li>In <a href="#FIGXVI">Fig. E</a> the cylinder is set too far to the right.</li>

<li>In <a href="#FIGXVI">Fig. F</a> the cylinder is set too low and too far to the right.</li>

<li>In <a href="#FIGXVI">Fig. G</a> the cylinder is set too low and too far to the left.</li>

<li>In <a href="#FIGXVI">Fig. H</a> the cylinder is set too high and too far to the left.</li>

<li>In <a href="#FIGXVI">Fig. K</a> the cylinder is set too high and too far to the right.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the machine produces wrong lifts of the hooks and the trouble is not found
in the setting of the cylinder, nor in the hooks or needles, then ascertain if the
cylinder is adjusted by means of the lever arrangement, close enough to the needle-board;
for if it is not, the hooks will not be pushed far enough from the griffe-bars,
and by raising the latter a wrong shed will be produced. When using a great
number of cards in a set they are made to fold into a “rack.” This is done by
attaching a wire 1 to 1-1/2 inches longer than the cards at the junction of, say every
12th, 15th, or 20th cards. [See <i>c</i> at <a href="#FIGXV">Fig. XV</a>.]</p>

<p>The cards fall through a wooden frame, <a href="#FIGXVII">Fig. XVII</a>., but the wires attached
to the cards, being longer, can not pass through, and the cards will remain suspended,
and subsequently fold together in a very compact manner.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_JACQUARD_HARNESS" id="THE_JACQUARD_HARNESS"></a>THE JACQUARD HARNESS.</h2>


<p>To the lower end of the hooks (<i>c.</i> in <a href="#FIGV">Fig. V.</a>) the neck-cords are adjusted. The
latter are passed separately through one of the corresponding holes of the perforated
bottom board (<a href="#FIGII">Fig. II.</a>) To these neck-cords are fastened the leashes of the Jacquard
harness about 1/2 to 1 inch above the frame containing the rods which guide the
neck-cords vertically as the hooks are raised and lowered. The different harness-cords
are threaded through the comber-board in various ways called “Tie-ups,”
which will be explained later.</p>


<h3>The Comber-board and Methods of Figuring for it.</h3>

<p>There are two kinds of comber-boards used upon Jacquard looms:</p>

<p>1st. Comber-boards made of a solid piece of material, either wood or porcelain.</p>

<p>2d. Comber-boards made in strips of either of the materials above named, and
adjusted afterwards in a wooden frame.</p>


<h3>Comber-boards Made of a Solid Piece of Material.</h3>

<p>Before ordering a comber-board, it is necessary to know the texture of the
fabric in the loom, and also the number or size of the machine to be used; for the
number of holes per inch in the comber-board is regulated by this. Afterwards, we
may, if we choose, arrange the number of holes in depth of the comber-board,
according to the number of griffe-bars in the machine, (guided by the fabric to be
made). We may have eight griffe-bars in the machine, and arrange the comber-board
4, 6, 8, 10, 12 rows deep; or we may have 12 griffe-bars in the machine, and
arrange the comber-board 12, 10, 8, 6, 4 rows deep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rule</span>: The number of holes to one inch in the comber-board must equal the
texture of the fabric to one inch in loom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Example</span>: Suppose a fabric with a texture in the loom of 100 threads, and we are
to use a 600 Jacquard machine, with 12 rows. The width of the fabric in the loom is
to be 36 inches.</p>

<ul class="nostyle">
<li><i>Required</i>: The number of holes in the width of the comber-board.</li>

<li><i>Answer</i>: 100 × 36 = 3600 holes in the comber-board.</li>

<li>3600 ÷ 12 = 300, the number of holes in width.</li>
</ul>

<p>The width and depth of the comber-board are regulated by the width of the cloth
required and by the design to be used.</p>

<p>The greater the number of rows in depth the closer they must be; the same is
true of the width.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>It is necessary to take care not to have the comber-board too deep, as the
consequence would be a bad shed; furthermore, we must not have the holes too
close together, as in a high texture this would make trouble in the weaving through
the catching of the heddles with the warp, and also cause useless chafing of the warp-threads
and the heddles.</p>


<h3>The Changing of Solid Comber-boards for Different Textures.</h3>

<p>In Jacquard work we generally use the same texture, or as near as possible, as
the loom is tied up for; but changes are sometimes unavoidable. If we reduce the
texture of the fabric in a Jacquard loom tied-up for a solid comber-board, we must
reduce proportionally the number of hooks and needles used in designing, and hence
the number of heddles used per inch. These heddles will thus be left empty when
drawing in the warp. To accomplish this lift the full machine and throw the hooks not
to be used from the knives, lowering in this way every mail which is not to be used.
Sometimes there may be only one, two, three, or four hooks to be thrown off, on
account of the design. At other times it may be necessary that one-eighth, or one-fourth,
or even one-half of the whole number shall be dropped for this purpose. For
instance, suppose we have a dressgoods design of 596 threads and a 600 machine.
These four ends left off the 600, if in 6, 7, 8, or more inches in width, would not affect
the fabric nor the cost to any great extent; hence we may leave out the first or last
four needles of the 600.</p>

<p>Suppose we have a texture of 100 in the comber-board, to lower to 66 ends
per inch. 66 ends, or the nearest even part of 100 (66-2/3) is 2/3 of 100; hence, we
only need two-thirds of our machine; and as the same is supposed to be arranged
12 rows deep, we need 2/3 of 12 rows, or 8 rows. The four rows thus found
necessary to drop may be dropped from the ends, or alternately, as follows:</p>

<p>Every alternate 2 rows taken, 1 row missed, 4 times over, = 12 rows. Or, 2
rows missed, 8 rows taken, 2 rows missed, = 12 rows.</p>


<h3>Comber-boards made in Strips and Adjusted afterwards in a Frame.</h3>

<p>By these comber-boards which are used to a great advantage on narrow loom
work up to 36 inch fabrics, we can change the texture for the fabric; for the strips
composing the comber-board may be drawn apart, thus changing the higher texture
to lower; whereas in a solid comber-board this could only be done by re-tying the
harness or changing the number of needles used in the machine. To give a clear
understanding Figs. <a href="#FIGXVIII">XVIII.</a>, <a href="#FIGXIX">XIX.</a>, <a href="#FIGXX">XX.</a> are needed.</p>


<p><a href="#FIGXVIII">Fig. XVIII.</a> represents an 8-row deep comber-board, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, composed of
10 strips which are set close together. By examining each strip 5 cross-rows of
holes will be found, making the whole number of holes 400.</p>

<p>Suppose the comber-board as represented in <a href="#FIGXVIII">Fig. XVIII.</a> is intended for a
texture of 100 ends per inch; this will give for the width of the fabric (<i>i</i>, <i>k</i>, to <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>,)
4 inches.</p>

<p>In <a href="#FIGXIX">Fig. XIX.</a> the comber-board is arranged for a texture of half as many ends,
or 50 holes per inch, and the 10 strips are arranged accordingly; the empty places
between the strips are of same size as the strips themselves, and the fabric design
below the comber-board is arranged to correspond.</p>

parts of these figures which correspond.</p>


<h3>Divisions of the Comber-board.</h3>

<p>Under this heading we classify one repeat of the arrangement of threading
harness-cords in the comber-board, and therefore one repeat of the design of
the fabric. We find fabrics in which are used one or more divisions of one
system of threading harness-cords in the comber-board; again, there are
others in which one or more divisions of one system are combined with one
or more divisions of another, or even of two or three other systems.</p>

</div>

<p>This requires a clear conception of the rotation in which the
different heddles are threaded, according to the tie-up employed.
Two methods are in use: 1st. The heddle nearest the weaver is
the first to be threaded, and the heddle of the same row in rear of
the comber-board is the last. 2d. This principle reversed, thus
arranging the leasing from rear to front.</p>

<p>The latter method is the one most generally observed. Every
row in depth of comber-board is leased separately, and in rotation
secured to the lease-twines, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, in <a href="#FIGXXIV">Fig. XXIV.</a>, thus forming an
uninterrupted line of heddles through the entire Jacquard harness.
Through these heddles the warp is afterwards drawn in rotation.</p>

<h3>1. The Straight-Through Tie-up.</h3>

<p>This tie-up contains in its principle the foundation of all the others. Three
methods are in common use, which we will now explain.</p>


<h3>1st. The Jacquard Harness threaded on the machine in the direction from Front to Rear.</h3>

<p>This tie-up is represented in <a href="#FIGXXV">Fig. XXV.</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
<a name="FIGXXV" id="FIGXXV"></a><img src="images/i_024.jpg" width="350" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. XXV.</span></div>
</div>

<p>As mentioned in the heading of this article, the Jacquard harness, or the
leashes, are fastened to the machine in rotation from front to rear, the threading of
the comber-board being done from rear to front. The comber-board is in three
divisions. The machine used for illustrating is a 400 Jacquard 8-row machine, and
the comber-board used is also 8 rows deep. This method of tying-up of the
leashes forms what is technically known as “open harness.” As the drawing is
designed to explain a 400 machine, 8 rows drawn in the comber-board, also 8 rows
deep, one row in height of the cylinder will equal one row in depth on the comber-board.
In examining the illustration the eye must follow the line connecting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
numbers on the neck-cords to the corresponding numbers near the holes on the
comber-board. If this be done, the tie-up will readily explain itself. It will also
explain the method of procedure if
a machine is used containing a different
number of needles and hooks,
and a comber-board having as many
rows in depth as there are griffe-bars
in the machine. For example,
a 600 machine, with 12 griffe-bars,
needs for this tie-up a comber-board
12 rows deep; and a 200 machine,
with 8 griffe-bars, requires a comber-board
8 rows deep, etc., etc.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 309px;">
<a name="FIGXXVI" id="FIGXXVI"></a><img src="images/i_025.jpg" width="309" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. XXVI.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The drawing shows a comber-board
with 3 divisions, each division
furnishing one harness-cord to each
neck-cord, making in all three harness-cords
to every neck-cord. The
same tie-up will apply should the
drawing contain a different number
of divisions. The illustration shows
only the first and last rows of each
division in the comber-board, and
also the first and last rows of neck-cords.</p>

<p>The design below the drawing
represents a damask fabric to be
executed on this tie-up, requiring
the whole number of needles for one
repeat of the pattern of 400 threads.
In designing for these tie-ups it is
necessary to arrange the design
to repeat itself in the number of
needles that will be used in producing
the fabric. The first and last threads must connect with each other, without
interruption, forming a continuous design over all the divisions. Thus we find, in
fabric design of a damask towel, <a href="#FIGXXVI">Fig. XXVI.</a>, the repeat (division) from <i>A</i> to <i>B</i>.
In the centre of the design marked <i>a</i>, and the main part of the border marked <i>c</i>, we
find one repeat; whereas borders <i>b</i> and <i>b´</i> repeat 8 times.</p>

<p>In the fabric illustrated by design, <a href="#FIGXXVII">Fig. XXVII.</a>, again a damask towel, the
repeat, or one division, is also indicated by <i>A</i> to <i>B</i>. The centre of the fabric, <i>a</i>,
repeats twice in one division; borders <i>b</i> and <i>b´</i> repeat four times in the same distance;
whereas the main design of the border indicated by <i>c</i> requires one complete division.</p>

<h3>2d. The Jacquard Harness threaded on the machine from Rear to Front.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 382px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. XXVIII.</span></div>
</div>

<p>This is the second method for the straight-through tie-up, and is illustrated in
<a href="#FIGXXVIII">Fig. XXVIII.</a> The Jacquard harness is fastened to the machine, at the neck-cords,
from rear to front. The threading of the comber-board is also from rear to front.
In this method the work of attaching the leashes to the neck-cords is commenced in
the rear instead of the front of the machine, thus giving a different view and
arrangement of the tie-up. This disposition of the threads is called a “sectional
harness arrangement.”</p>

<p>The illustration shows a 400 Jacquard or 8-row machine, in connection with an
8-row deep comber-board, with one row in the comber-board requiring a
corresponding row on the face of the cylinder. It will also explain the method of
procedure with this tie-up in Jacquard machines with comber-boards of different sizes.</p>

<p><a href="#FIGXXIX">Fig. XXIX.</a> represents the perforated board at the bottom of the machine
through which the neck-cords pass, attaching the leash to the neck-cords. The first
row, containing neck-cords numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, and the 50th row,
containing those numbered 393, 394, 395, 396, 397, 398, 399, and 400, are the only
ones shown in <a href="#FIGXXVIII">Fig. XXVIII.</a> illustrating the tie-up. The comber-board is divided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
into four sections; hence, the drawing, as represented in <a href="#FIGXXVIII">Fig. XXVIII.</a>, calls for a
fabric with 1600 ends in width. 400 ends, or any number dividing into 400, can be
used for the repeat of the pattern. The method followed in the illustration may be
applied to any size of Jacquard machine, and also to any required number of
divisions in the comber-board.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 306px;">
<a name="FIGXXIX" id="FIGXXIX"></a><img src="images/i_028.jpg" width="306" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. XXIX.</span></div>
</div>

<p>In ascertaining the number of
hooks or needles for one repeat of
the design, determine accurately if
the repeat of the weave employed
for binding <i>the ground</i> or the figure
divides evenly into this number.
For example, take bottom board,
<a href="#FIGXXIX">Fig. XXIX.</a>, calling for 400 hooks
and 400 needles. Suppose the
ground weave to be an 8-leaf satin,
and the design to repeat once in
the 400 hooks. 400 ÷ 8 = 50
repeats, showing an equal division
But suppose a 12-leaf satin is used;
it is obvious that 12 is not an even
factor of 400, as the division shows
a remainder of 4. To dispose of
this remainder two methods are
open:</p>

<p>First. Omit last 4 ends and use
only 396 hooks, a multiple of 12,
giving 33 repeats; or,</p>

<p>Second. Add 8 hooks from the
reserve rows, elsewhere previously
alluded to, thus increasing the number
to 408, which is also a multiple
of 12, giving 34 repeats.</p>


<h3>3d. The Straight-Through Tie-up on
the English System.</h3>

<p>The English system, which is
widely used, has the Jacquard machine
so adjusted upon the loom as
to have the cylinder lengthways,
running in the same direction as
the comber-board; or, what is the
same thing, running in the direction of the width of the fabric. [See <a href="#FIGXXX">Fig. XXX</a>.]</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 402px;">
<a name="FIGXXX" id="FIGXXX"></a><img src="images/i_029.jpg" width="402" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. XXX.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The 8 hooks of one cross-row (one hook from each of the 8 griffe-bars) run in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
direction from the cloth beam towards the warp beam. Having the same number of
rows in depth, in comber-board as there are griffe-bars, one may readily see the
advantages of this tie-up. The first row in depth of the comber-board contains
harness-cords from neck-cords 1 to 8. The second row deep of comber-board
contains harness-cords from neck-cords
9 to 16, finishing each division
on the last (25th) row, with
harness-cords from neck-cords
193 to 200.</p>

<p>Should we have a 600 machine,
with 12 rows, the comber-board
would also have 12 rows,
as the 600 machine contains 12
griffe-bars. The first row of the
comber-board receives the harness-cords
from Nos. 1 to 12;
the second row from Nos. 13 to
24, and so on, finishing on the
last (50th) row of comber-board
with 589 to 600.</p>


<h3>II. Straight-Through Tie-up for
Repeated Effects, in one
Repeat of the Design.</h3>

<p>This method of arranging the
tying-up of the Jacquard harness
is based upon the necessity for
producing patterns having a
larger number of warp-threads
than the Jacquard used has needles.
The principle to be observed
is found in producing
small effects which repeat themselves
in the general design.</p>

<p>The number of cords for the leashes depends upon the frequency with which
these repeats occur. Fabrics with stripe effects offer greater opportunities for
reducing the number of hooks and needles than other designs. <a href="#FIGXXXI">Fig. XXXI.</a>
illustrates such a design with its tie-up, using a 400 Jacquard machine with 8 rows.
The pattern shows four distinct effects, as follows:</p>

<ul class="nostyle">
<li><i>A</i>, requiring rows 1 to 16, inclusive; or harness-cords 1 to 128, inclusive.</li>

<li><i>B</i>, requiring rows 17 to 21, inclusive; or harness-cords 129 to 168, inclusive.</li>

<li><i>C</i>, requiring rows 22 to 34; or harness-cords 169 to 272, inclusive.</li>

<li><i>D</i>, requiring rows 35 to 50; or harness-cords 273 to 400, inclusive.</li>

<li>In this fabric we find 2 full repeats of the design: first, <i>E</i> to <i>F</i>;
second, <i>E´´</i> to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
<i>F´´</i>, thus requiring two divisions in the comber-board, as indicated by the vertical
line between <i>F</i> and <i>E´´</i>.</li>
</ul>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 540px;">
<a name="FIGXXXI" id="FIGXXXI"></a><img src="images/i_030fp.jpg" width="540" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. XXXI.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The next subject to consider is the different arrangement of repeated effects in
one division. Commence at the left-hand side of the fabric sketch with effect <i>A</i>,
which repeats only once in one pattern or one division. The illustration shows two
divisions, and also that each hook of rows 1 to 16, inclusive, in the first division can
be connected with each hook of rows 1 to 16, inclusive, in the second division, because
these rows produce the same effect in the design, which repeats itself in these two
places. This connection forms what is technically called a leash, and it will always
be found that for every harness-cord a leash contains, there will be found a repeat in
the design to correspond.</p>

<p>Effect <i>B</i> is repeated four times in the design, or in each division. By having
two divisions for the illustration we find that to produce the necessary repeats in
the design each hook of rows 17 to 21, inclusive, requires 8 harness-cords to each
leash.</p>

<p>Effect <i>C</i> repeats twice in one pattern or one division. Having two divisions for
the illustration, each hook of row 22, including row 34, requires 4 harness-cords to
each leash.</p>

<p>Effect <i>D</i> repeats once in pattern, once in division. This will give a result
similar to <i>A</i>, two divisions, row 35, including row 50, with two harness-cords to each
leash. This tie-up illustrates the first row of every effect, and also the last leash,
400.</p>

<p>Adding the number of warp-threads in the full repeat of the pattern, we have:</p>

<table class="tablel" border="0"  summary="sum of warp threads in pattern" >
<tr><td class ="tdl2">Effect A &nbsp;=&nbsp;</td><td class="tdl">128 threads.</td></tr>
<tr><td class ="tdl2">Effect B &nbsp;=&nbsp;</td><td class="tdl">&nbsp; 40 threads.</td></tr>
<tr><td class ="tdl2">Effect C &nbsp;=&nbsp;</td><td class="tdl"> 104 threads.</td></tr>
<tr><td class ="tdl2">Effect B &nbsp;=&nbsp;</td><td class="tdl">&nbsp; 40 threads.</td></tr>
<tr><td class ="tdl2">Effect D &nbsp;=&nbsp;</td><td class="tdl"> 128 threads.</td></tr>
<tr><td class ="tdl2">Effect B &nbsp;=&nbsp;</td><td class="tdl">&nbsp; 40 threads.</td></tr>
<tr><td class ="tdl2">Effect C &nbsp;=&nbsp;</td><td class="tdl"> 104 threads.</td></tr>
<tr><td class ="tdl2">Effect B &nbsp;=&nbsp;</td><td class="tdl">&nbsp; 40 threads.</td></tr>
<tr><td class ="tdl2">&nbsp;</td><td class="tdl">----</td></tr>
<tr><td class ="tdl2">&nbsp;</td><td class="tdl">624 threads.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="pclear">Or, in other words, we are producing with a “straight-through tie-up for repeated
effects” on a 400 Jacquard machine, a design, which would require a 600 machine on
a common straight-through tie-up, including the two reserve rows, or 624 needles;
in other words, a saving is made of 224 needles in one full repeat of the pattern.</p>

<p>In designing for looms tied up for similar styles, the repeats of effects must be
kept in mind. The general style of every design may be changed, but the
arrangement of the repeated effects cannot be altered without changing the entire
Jacquard harness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>


<h3>III. Straight-Through Tie-up of a Jacquard Loom having Front Harness Attached.</h3>

<p>As mentioned in the beginning of this work, every Jacquard machine contains
two reserve rows, which may be used for various purposes. One of the purposes
to which these rows are frequently put is the enlargement of the design of the
fabric by using harness on the front of the comber-board, technically known as
“front harness.” For example, in damask table-cloths, we may use the Jacquard
harness for producing the border of the fabric. The centre part may be produced
with front harness, forming a checkerboard, or some similar effect. This process
may be reversed by designing the
centre of the table-cloth for the Jacquard
harness, and the border for the
front harness.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 394px;">
<a name="FIGXXXII" id="FIGXXXII"></a><img src="images/i_031.jpg" width="394" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. XXXII.</span></div>
</div>

<p>A third method is to design part
of the centre and part of the border
for the Jacquard harness, the other
parts being designed for the front
harness. This tie-up is also used to
a great extent in the manufacture of
dressgoods, etc., where stripe effects
produced by the front harness, alternate
with floral or geometrical designs
produced by the Jacquard harness.</p>

<p>In <a href="#FIGXXXIII">Fig. XXXIII.</a> the centre of a
table-cloth cover is shown to further
illustrate this method of tying-up.
One-half of the width of the design is
for the Jacquard harness; the other
half is for the front harness. To produce
the required checkerboard effect
these front harness are used here in
two distinct sets.</p>

<p>The 1st set = 5 harness, working
on the 5-leaf satin warp for face,
alternating with the</p>

<p>2d set = 5 harness, working on
the 5-leaf satin filling for face.</p>

<p>If only 8 front harness should be used for the design, we should have the</p>

<ul class="nostyle">
<li>1st set = 4 harness, working on the 4 harness broken twill warp for face.</li>

<li>2d set = 4 harness, working on the 4 harness broken twill filling for face.</li>
</ul>

<p>Set 1 to alternate with set 2 to form the check. Care must be taken that the
number of checks formed by the front harness are evenly arranged to the figured
part of the fabric. For example, <a href="#FIGXXXIII">Fig. XXXIII.</a>, in the front harness part of the
design shows 5 warp checks and 5 filling checks in one row, = 10 checks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="FIGXXXIII" id="FIGXXXIII"></a><img src="images/i_032.jpg" width="300" height="287" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. XXXIII.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Suppose 10 front harness are used and 20 warp-threads allowed for each check;
then 20 × 10 = 200 warp-threads, all used for effects by the front harness.</p>

<p>This requires 200 warp-threads
for figure effects
to be used by the Jacquard
harness.</p>

<p>The repeat of the pattern
is therefore 400 warp-threads,
which is produced
by straight-through tie-up,
front harness attached,
with 200 hooks and needles
for <span class="smcap">FIGURE PART</span> of the
design, <i>plus</i> 10 hooks and
needles for <span class="smcap">CHECKERBOARD
PART</span> of the fabric taken
from the 16 hooks and
needles of 2 reserve rows,
leaves 6 hooks and needles
for selvedge, etc.</p>

<p>As previously stated,
the front harness may be
used for dressgoods fabrics.
In this way the design
may be enlarged to any required extent.</p>

<p><a href="#FIGXXXII">Fig. XXXII.</a> illustrates this method, using an 8-row Jacquard machine, with
4 front harness adjusted, in common use for the manufacture of dressgoods fabrics,
damasks, etc.</p>

</div>

<p><a href="#FIGXXXIV">Fig. XXXIV.</a> shows a fabric
designed for dressgoods forming
an all-over-set pattern. In this
design parts <i>F</i> and <i>F´´</i> must
be executed with the Jacquard
leashes; parts <i>G</i> and <i>G</i> can be
executed with front harness. For
example: parts <i>F</i> and <i>F´´</i> require
each 100 hooks, the ground part
to be woven in 4 harness broken
twill. We find the answer as to
number of warp-threads in the
repeat and number of hooks required
for weaving as follows:</p>

<h3 class="pclear">IV. The Centre Tie-up.</h3>

<p>The centre tie-up, also called the point tie-up, has for its purpose the
enlargement of the design in fabrics such as table-covers, dressgoods, etc. This
tie-up resembles in its principle that of a common
point-draw on the harness-loom. After drawing
from front to rear once straight through the
entire set of harness, draw from rear to front
and repeat. The only difference between
harness-work and Jacquard work is in the fact, that with harness we commence to
draw in from the first harness straight through to the last, <i>A</i> to <i>B</i>, and back again,
<i>B</i> to <i>C</i>; but with the Jacquard tie-up on this method this is arranged through the
threading of the comber-board, having a straight-through leasing of the heddles and
drawing in of the warp.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="FIGXXXV" id="FIGXXXV"></a><img src="images/i_033.jpg" width="600" height="175" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. XXXV.</span></div>
</div>

<p>In <a href="#FIGXXXV">Fig. XXXV.</a> there is a clear illustration given of the principle of the centre
tie-up on an 8-row comber-board <i>A</i>, <i>A´</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>B´</i>. In laying out the comber board, it
must be divided by the line <i>C</i>, <i>C´</i>, into two equal parts, <i>D</i>, <i>C</i>, and <i>C</i>, <i>D´</i>. In the part
<i>A</i>, <i>A´</i>, <i>C</i>, <i>C´</i>, of the comber-board, we commence threading with leash 1 at the left-hand
rear corner, running in succession towards the centre, as indicated by the
arrow on this part of the comber-board.</p>

<p>In part <i>B</i>, <i>B´</i>, <i>C</i>, <i>C´</i>, the threading begins in the opposite corner, to the right-hand
in front, with number 1 leash, threading in rotation the number of leashes from
the front towards the rear, as again indicated on the figure by an arrow. After
leasing and threading the harness, No. 1 leash will contain in its two mails the first

<p><a href="#FIGXXXVI">Fig. XXXVI.</a> represents
this centre or point tie-up applied
to a 200 Jacquard machine;
comber-board, 8 rows
deep; two full divisions; <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>,
the first division; <i>B</i>, <i>D</i>, the
second division; <i>C</i> and <i>C´</i> forming
the centre in each division.
This machine will, if tied-up in
this manner, produce a design
requiring 400 warp-threads.
We must arrange the design
for this tie-up so as to repeat
forwards and backwards respectively
in the centre. Such
a design will run upwards at a
given angle to a definite point,
then it will return by the same
angle in an opposite direction
until it reaches the base from
which it originally started.</p>

<h3>V. “Straight-Through” and “Point” Tie-ups Combined.</h3>

<p><i>A.&mdash;For fabrics requiring for their centres a straight-through tie-up and for their
borders a point tie-up, one-half division of it for each border.</i></p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. XXXVIII.</span></div>
</div>

<p>These tie-ups are used to a great extent for napkins, handkerchiefs, scarfs, and
similar damask fabrics, in which the centre part of the fabric is worked on the straight-through
method; the borders on each side on the point tie-up, repeating equally from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
centre towards the selvedge. In the other two borders to be woven at the beginning
and the end of the fabric, the same principle is observed, thus producing four corner
squares, only two of which need be designed, as the other two repeat through the
arrangement of the tie-up, which must repeat equally towards both sides of the
border at the connecting places.</p>

<p><a href="#FIGXXXVIII">Fig. XXXVIII.</a> illustrates this method of tying-up a 200 machine, using 192
hooks and needles, equal to 24 long rows of a regular 8-row deep machine. The
machine is divided into two sections, as follows:</p>

</div>

<p class="pclear">The drawing represents four divisions for the centre, hence four harness-cords
for each leash. The border, having only two repeats in the fabric, will contain
only two harness-cords to one leash. In
the drawing the first full row of the machine
is indicated, which is equal to the first
row deep of every centre division; containing
harness-cords 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
We also show (heavy line) the last centre
leash, No. 96 being the last hook of row 12
of the machine. The borders <i>A´</i> and <i>A´´</i> are
from the same design, but the figure runs in
an opposite direction in each one, as indicated
by the arrows in the comber-board above.
Border <i>A´</i> commences with harness-cord from
leash 192, ending with harness-cord from
leash 97, near the centre design. Border <i>A´´</i>
commences with harness-cord from leash 97,
near the centre design, ending with harness-cord
from leash 192 near the selvedge. The great difficulty to be overcome in
arranging these patterns for the loom is in the union of the two tie-ups, the straight-through
and the point.</p>

<p>As previously stated, the borders <i>A´</i> and <i>A´´</i> are made with the point tie-up, while
the remainder of the borders are made with the straight-through tie-up. The combination
of these two tie-ups occurs in the corner squares of the border, and the
arrangement must be such as will permit the two sides of the corner patterns to
properly unite with the design for the balance of the border.</p>

<p>Ground plan for above fabric: Letters <i>A</i>, <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>F</i>, correspond to same letters
as used on the outside of fabric design. <i>S</i>, <i>S´</i>, <i>S´´</i>, <i>S´´´</i>, <i>S´´´´</i>, also correspond for
centre division.</p>

<p><a href="#FIGXLI">Fig. XLI.</a> illustrates this method of tying-up adjusted to a 600 Jacquard
machine. The centre of the fabric requires 400 needles and hooks in 6 repeats or
divisions, or 400 × 6 = 2400 warp-threads. The border calls for 204 needles and
hooks, point tie-up, one full division for each side, or 204 × 2 x 2 = 816 warp-threads.
The arrangement of margin and selvedge, as applied on each side, is explained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>

8 needles and 8 hooks in machine, 6 repeats of same for each side, or 96 warp-threads.
The selvedge is formed by 2, 4 or 8 needles, (working plain), and has
24 heddles for each side or 48 selvedge-threads in warp. These selvedge ends may,
if preferred, be drawn two ends in one heddle. By adding these different systems
of threads we find:</p>

<p>This tie-up is the one most frequently employed in the manufacture of damask
table-covers. Not only will drawings and explanations lead to a thorough
understanding of the procedure, but they will also readily show the great variety of
textile fabrics to which the principle of this tie-up may be applied.</p>

<p><a href="#FIGXLIII">Fig. XLIII.</a> illustrates the margin arranged 8 threads for each row, and 5
rows or 40 threads for each side. The selvedge in this drawing is illustrated
by one complete row of 12 double threads for each side. The selvedge and
margin holes are all represented shaded. The selvedge is marked <i>S</i> in addition
to the number. The five margin rows are indicated each by figures 1 to 8. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
nearest row of border is also represented, being numbered 401 to 412,
corresponding to <a href="#FIGXLI">Fig. XLI.</a> This method of using only 8 rows of the 12-row deep
comber-board is extensively used in fabrics of a common texture, employing an
8 harness satin for the margin as weave, which repeats once for each row in
comber-board. Besides, a great advantage results from being able to tie-up 8 leashes
threaded 8 rows deep in comber-board to the 8 hooks in 1 row of the machine,
which the weave calls for.</p>

<p>This method of tying-up is illustrated in <a href="#FIGXLVI">Fig. XLVI.</a>, and the fabric produced in
<a href="#FIGXLVII">Fig. XLVII.</a> With this method of tying-up is usually introduced an extra margin for
the purpose of separating the ornamentation of the design, so as to permit of a clearer
definition. This is tied-up on 8 needles and hooks, situated between border and
centre, (24 ends) shown at margin <i>B</i> in the design. The centre of the fabric, (two
divisions only illustrated out of ten actually used), is tied-up on the straight-through
method, requiring for its working, harness-cords 1 to 240. The border has
the point tie-up in half sections; these half sections have a straight-through tie-up
design in its centre. Harness-cords 241 to 456 are used for the straight-through
section, and 457 to 600 for the point tie-up section. The margin is produced by
harness-cords 601 to 608, leaving 16 needles and hooks of the machine unemployed,
which may be used for selvedge or other purposes. The drawing of this tie-up and
fabric illustrates only the right-hand side. The complete design requires, in
addition to the borders and margins, 10 divisions or repeats in the centre. The
figure shows only two of these repeats and border and margins of one side. The
number of ends in the fabric is found as follows:</p>

<h3>Straight-Through and Point Tie-ups Combined.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>E.&mdash;Mixed Tie-up.</i></p>

<p>Containing in one repeat of the design the straight-through tie-up and
the point tie-up, one full division, for the centre; the point tie-up, in half
divisions, repeating once through on each side of the fabric, to make the border.
These arrangements of tie-ups are used to a great extent in the manufacture of
damask fabrics of every denomination.</p>

<p>The principle of using mixed tie-ups, <a href="#FIGLII">Fig. LII.</a>, is found in the necessity of
producing large designs, containing varied effects, with a proportionally smaller
Jacquard machine. Under whatever management the straight-through and the
point tie-ups are combined, their principle remains undisturbed. Every time we
arrange a Jacquard loom on a mixed tie-up, we must consider that any subsequent
design must be arranged with reference to the same principle as the one in use,
otherwise the work must all be rearranged, which would have to be done even for
the smallest change in the number of ends for each effect.</p>

</div>

<p>Take for illustration a damask fabric, <a href="#FIGLII">Fig. LIII.</a>, handkerchief, bureau scarf,
art square, etc. The details given will make the work quite plain:</p>

<p>Part of comber-board from <i>A</i> to <i>B</i>, or <i>D</i> to <i>C</i>, illustrates one-half of the board
and procedure of tying-up. The design below also shows only one-half of the
fabric. Arrow, <i>G</i>, near comber-board, and arrow, <i>M</i>, near fabric, are placed to
indicate the direction in which a repeat is obtained. The fabric will form its centre
at <i>D</i>, repeating towards each border and selvedge. This is illustrated in the
comber-board by the 1-row deep, outside of line <i>A</i>, <i>D</i>. Harness-cords indicated
by dotted lines. The threading of this last mentioned row, as well as the threading
of the half division of the point tie-up, is indicated by arrows <i>H</i> and <i>K</i>, forming the
centre by means of harness-cords 193 and 193. The straight-through tie-up part of
the fabric is found between <i>E</i> and <i>F</i>, containing 12 repeats in the centre, and also
the same number in the lower border. In the comber-board is illustrated this
arrangement, repeating the first row, containing harness-cords 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
twelve times, and the last hole of the third row containing harness-cord No. 24,
twelve times. On the bottom of the comber-board these 12 repeats are indicated
by 12 small arrows between parts <i>E</i> to <i>F</i>.</p>

<p>The first row in the first division of the straight-through tie-up is completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
threaded; the other eleven have only the harness-cord from leash 1, as indicated; this
is done so as not to confuse the eye with too many lines. The border of the fabric
is arranged for harness-cords 25 to 192 on the point tie-up, having one-half division<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
on each side. Arrow <i>L</i> indicates the right-hand border. The border on the left
requires the same harness-cords which are threaded in comber-board from right to
left; hence the borders of the fabric contain the same design repeating from the
centre towards the selvedge.</p>

<p>At the beginning we stated that the use of mixed tie-ups made it possible to
employ a smaller size Jacquard machine for large designs containing various
effects. The following analysis of <a href="#FIGLII">Fig. LII.</a> shows very clearly how this is done.</p>

<p>Number of warp-ends in one complete repeat in width of the fabric:</p>

<p>
Border, right-hand,   = 168 threads.<br />
Centre, straight-tie, = 288 threads.<br />
Centre, point-tie,&nbsp;{ = 168 threads.<br />
<span class="in7">{ = 168 threads.</span><br />
Centre, straight-tie, = 288 threads.<br />
Border, left-hand,&nbsp; &nbsp; = 168 threads.<br />
<span class="wide"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>-----<br />
<span class="wide"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1248 ends warp in fabric.
</p>

<p>Number of needles required to produce the design:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Border, = 168 needles.</p>

<p>Centre on straight-tie, = 24 needles.</p>

<p>Centre on point-tie, = 168 needles.</p>

<p>360 needles required for producing the complete design, thus saving the
difference between 1248 and 360, or 888 needles; all of which is
accomplished through the use of the mixed tie-up.</p></blockquote>

<p>Number of harness-cords required for each leash:</p>

<p>Leashes 1 to 24 contain 24 cords for one repeat of the entire design. Leashes
25 to 360 contain 2 cords for one repeat of the entire design. It is not always
practicable to reduce the effects in a design to the lowest possible number of
needles. On account of the changes in styles, it is best to arrange these tie-ups with
a view to giving as much opportunity as possible to the designer. In the present
tie-up experience teaches that it will be more advantageous to arrange the straight-through
tie-up either for 6 divisions to 48 ends each, or 4 divisions to 72 ends each.
360 needles, as figured at the beginning, require a 400 machine, or, counting reserve
rows, 416 needles; hence we can, without disadvantage, increase 360 needles to 384
or 408, which will give a greater scope, if required, to make a new design.</p>


<h3>VI. The Straight-Through Tie-up in Two Sections.</h3>

<h3><i>A.&mdash;Using machine and comber-board in two equal sections.</i></h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="FIGLIV" id="FIGLIV"></a><img src="images/i_049.jpg" width="300" height="437" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. LIV.</span></div>
</div>

<p>This tie-up, <a href="#FIGLIV">Fig. LIV.</a>, is used on fabrics having two different kinds of warp,
which, as a rule, are of different colors. One of these warps is shown working
at <i>B</i> in the comber-board, and also at the bottom-board. The other warp employed
for the figure effect is shown working at <i>A</i>. Fabrics that are made on this
tie-up can also be made on the common straight-through; but the work of designing
and card stamping will be largely increased. In the illustration all the figure-threads,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and also all the threads
used for the weave (binder-threads)
can be designed without
interruption to each other. The
breaking off of the figures is thus
avoided, a thing quite impossible
where the regular straight-through
tie-up is used. The drawing given
herewith represents this straight-through
tie-up in sections applied
to a 200 Jacquard machine. The
reserve rows are omitted. The
machine and the comber-board, it
will be observed, are divided into
two even parts. In one part, the
rear of <i>A</i>, of the comber-board
we thread only in the leashes
from needles 1 to 100, and in the
other part, front of <i>B</i>, from needles
101 to 200. Hence, the first
row of the comber-board contains
leashes 1 to 4 and 101 to 104; the
second row will contain leashes 5 to
8 and 105 to 108; the third row will
contain leashes 9 to 12 and 109 to
112, and so on, each division finishing
on the last row (25th) with
leashes 97 to 100 and 197 to 200.</p>

<p>The leasing of the threads is
always done by alternately threading
the harness-cords of section
<i>A</i> with section <i>B</i>. Hence, first
thread of the warp draws in first
mail of leash No. 1; second thread
of the warp draws in first mail of
leash No. 101; third thread of the
warp draws in first mail of leash
No. 2; fourth thread of the warp
draws in first mail of leash No. 102.</p>

<h3><i>B. Using two machines and a comber-board having equal sections.</i></h3>

</div>

<p>Sometimes two or more machines are employed in producing fabrics having
two systems of warps; each machine working on its own system. In this manner
<a href="#FIGLVI">Fig. LVI.</a> is executed, representing a straight-through tie-up arranged for two
Jacquard machines, <i>S</i> and <i>H</i>, in which the warp is drawn in the Jacquard harness as
follows: one end from machine <i>S</i>, one end from machine <i>H</i>. For explanation two
100 Jacquard machines are used for the purpose of simplifying the arrangements of
laying out and threading the comber-board. A larger Jacquard machine for the
illustrations would require more leashes, and the explanation would be more difficult.</p>

<p>The comber-board, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, is divided into two equal parts, <i>S</i> and <i>H</i>. Each
part containing the harness-cord for one machine only. The drawing of the tie-up is
arranged for two divisions, and also readily
explains any tie-up for more divisions.</p>

<p>The leasing of the Jacquard harness,
<i>K</i>, is arranged (as illustrated in the drawing
by leash-rods <i>p</i> and <i>r</i>) to commence as
follows:</p>

<p>1st end: harness-cord fastened to No.
1 needle of machine, <i>S</i>; 2d end to No. 1º
needle of machine, <i>H</i>; 3d end to No. 2
needle of machine, <i>S</i>; 4th end to No. 2º
needle of machine, <i>H</i>; 5th end to No. 3
needle of machine, <i>S</i>; 6th end to No. 3º
needle of machine, <i>H</i>; 7th end to No. 4
needle of machine, <i>S</i>; 8th end to No. 4º
needle of machine, <i>H</i>.</p>

<p>These eight ends, forming the first
complete row of the comber-board, will
use the first row of both machines; the
second row of the comber-board will use
the second row of both machines; and so
on, until every row of the comber-board,
with corresponding row of the Jacquard
machine, is taken up. In the drawing we
have indicated, as usual, besides the first row, the last row of the machine and the
comber-board; or, in other words, we show the threading of</p>

<p>
Warp end 193: harness-cord fastened to No. 97 needle of harness <i>S</i>.<br />
Warp end 194: harness-cord fastened to No.  97º needle of harness <i>H</i>.<br />
Warp end 195: harness-cord fastened to No. 98 needle of harness <i>S</i>.<br />
Warp end 196: harness-cord fastened to No.  98º needle of harness <i>H</i>.<br />
Warp end 197: harness-cord fastened to No.  99 needle of harness <i>S</i>.<br />
Warp end 198: harness-cord fastened to No.  99º needle of harness <i>H</i>.<br />
Warp end 199: harness-cord fastened to No.  100 needle of harness <i>S</i>.<br />
Warp end 200: harness-cord fastened to No.  100º needle of harness <i>H</i>.<br />

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. LVII.</span></div>
</div>

<p>This method of using two Jacquard machines, on the principle explained, is
employed on Jacquard looms for dressgoods figured with an extra warp, on upholstery
goods, and similar textile fabrics.</p>

<p><a href="#FIGLVII">Fig. LVII.</a> shows a fabric design for a curtain, to be executed on the straight-through
tie-up in two sections.</p>


<h3><i>C.&mdash;Using one machine and one comber-board: the machine unequally divided and
the comber-board equally divided.</i></h3>

<p>To explain, take the regular
upholstery fabric tie-up known as
“petty point,” on a 600 machine
12 rows in depth. 600 ÷ 12 = 50
+ 2 rows reserve = 52 rows in
width. We find used&mdash;</p>

<table class="tablel" summary="petty point tie up">
<tr><td class="tdr">1</td><td class="tdl2"> row for selvedge.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">10</td><td class="tdl2"> rows for binders (<i>B</i>).</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">41</td><td class="tdl2"> rows for figure (<i>A</i>).</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">---</td><td class="tdl2">&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">52 </td><td class="tdl2">rows.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="pclear">41 (rows figure) × 12 (needles
for one row) = 492 needles to be
used for figure.</p>

<p>10 (rows binder) × 12 (needles
for one row) = 120 needles to be
used for binder.</p>

<p>Suppose we have four divisions
in loom, hence, four harness-cords
to one leash, for the figure
section, or 492 × 4 = 1968 ends of
warp used for figure. 1968 threads
of figure warp require the same
number of threads of ground warp,
which must be divided by 120, the
number of needles and hooks set
apart for it in the machine, or&mdash;as
each needle and hook carries one
leash&mdash;120 leashes. 1968 ÷ 120 = 16 repeats; and 48 leashes, or four rows in the
machine, must each have 17 harness-cords carrying 816 threads; and 72 leashes, or
six rows in the machine, must each have 16 harness-cords carrying 1152 threads,
= 1968.</p>


<h3>VII. Tying-up a Jacquard Harness for Figuring Part of the Design with an
Extra Warp, (part for Two Sections, part for Single).</h3>

<p>This tie-up (the character of which is indicated in <a href="#FIGXLVIII">Fig. LVIII.</a>) is used for textile
fabrics having two distinct warps in part of the fabric, and a single warp in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
remainder, for ground only. It will readily be seen in the drawing which explains this
tie-up that one part of the fabric will have to contain more ends of warp per inch than
the other, as the figuring is done with an extra warp upon the regular ground cloth.
The number of ends of ground warp per inch will, as a general rule, be the same
throughout the fabric. In <a href="#FIGLVIII">Fig. LVIII.</a>, explaining this method of tying-up, the texture
is twice as high in the figure stripe as in the ground part of the fabric. If 40
ends of warp per inch are used for the ground, 80 ends per inch must be used in the
figured part, <i>B</i> to <i>C</i>, <i>B´</i> to <i>C´</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 445px;">
<a name="FIGLVIII" id="FIGLVIII"></a><img src="images/i_052.jpg" width="445" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. LVIII.</span></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>A 200 machine is used in the illustration, divided as follows:</p>

<p class="in2">
150 needles for the ground over the entire fabric, <i>A</i> to <i>B´´</i>.<br />
<span class="in1">50 needles for the figure effects, <i>B</i> to <i>C</i>, and <i>B´</i> to <i>C´</i>.</span>
</p>

<p>The comber-board, therefore, must be arranged accordingly, (2-2/3 divisions in
drawing executed). The depth of the comber-board is divided into two parts:
<i>H</i>, <i>M</i>, <i>N</i>, <i>K</i>, the first; <i>M</i>, <i>N</i>, <i>O</i>, <i>P</i>, the second. The first contains leashes fastened
to neck-cords attached to needles 151 to 200, or the figure part, <i>F</i> and <i>F´</i>; the
second contains leashes fastened to neck-cords attached to the needles 1 to 150, or
the ground part for the entire fabric. In the drawing of lines showing the harness-cords
of the Jacquard harness we have only indicated:</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The ground part, leashes Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 in rotation, and No. 150. This
last leash of the ground warp we have indicated by a heavy line.</p>

<p><i>B.</i> For the figure part, needles 151 to 200 are used. Leashes 151, 152, 153,
154, are indicated in rotation, also the leash operated by hook 200; this latter one
being also lined more distinctly than the others.</p>

<p>These explanations readily show how to adapt the tying-up for any textile fabric
made upon this principle to any number Jacquard machine.</p>


<h3>VIII. The Straight-Through Tie-up in Three Sections.</h3>

<p>The straight-through tie-up in three sections, which is illustrated by drawings,
<a href="#FIGLIX">Figs. LIX.</a> and <a href="#FIGLX">LX.</a>, is largely used in the manufacture of fancy plushes and velvets,
and also in the construction of any other kinds of fabrics in which the face is figured
in three systems of warps, or in two systems of warps for the face and one system
for the binder.</p>

<p>If it were required, these fabrics could be made on the straight tie-up, (Figs.
<a href="#FIGXXV">XXV.</a>, <a href="#FIGXXXVIII">XXVIII.</a> and <a href="#FIGXXX">XXX.</a>), but, as will readily be seen, they may be worked to
much better advantage, both for designing and card-stamping, upon the method
shown here.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 536px;">
<a name="FIGLIX" id="FIGLIX"></a><img src="images/i_054.jpg" width="536" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. LIX.</span></div>
</div>

<p><a href="#FIGLIX">Fig. LIX.</a> illustrates the method of adjusting the leashes to the neck-cords and
threading the comber-board. In the example, we use for describing the method a
900 Jacquard machine, and follow the English system for placing it on the loom.
The machine is divided into three sections: Section 1, using hooks and needles 1 to
300; Section 2, using hooks and needles 301 to 600; Section 3, using hooks and
needles 601 to 900, leaving the two reserve rows (generally found in every machine)
out of the illustration.</p>

<p>The comber-board is divided into two divisions lengthways, (but the same method
must be observed if more than two divisions are used), and also into three sections
in its depth. The number of sections in the comber-board must correspond to the
number of sections in the machine.</p>

<p>The threading of the machine is done from the rear towards the front, and from
the left towards the right. The threading of the comber-board is done in a corresponding
manner. 300 ends for each section in one division, divided by 4 rows deep
each section, making 75 cross-rows. Threading of the Jacquard harness is as follows:</p>

<h3>X. Combination Tie-up in Two Sections. (“Tie-up Amalgamate.”)</h3>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. LXIII.</span></div>
</div>

<p>This tie-up illustrates the point tie-up and the straight-through combined on the
two-section system. In <a href="#FIGLXIII">Fig. LXIII.</a>, a 600 machine is used for illustration; the
comber-board being divided into two parts: <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, for No. 1 section; <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>,
for No. 2 section.</p>

<p>No. 1 section requires the use of needles and hooks 1 to 200 on the straight-through
principle, four divisions, taking 800 warp-threads.</p>

<p>No. 2 section requires the use of needles and hooks 201 to 600 on the point
principle, one division, taking 800 warp-threads. The two sections thus use 1600
warp-threads in one repeat.</p>

<p>The threading of the harness is as follows: 1-201, 2-202, 3-203, etc., ending
with 200-201.</p>

<p>This tie-up, as well as any changes in the arrangement and the number of needles,
(but not changed in its principle), is used for double color figures of warps of large
design, with a small all-over figure effect (No. 1 section) for the ground. <a href="#FIGLXIV">Fig.
LXIV.</a> is executed on this tie-up.</p>

</p>

<p>And so on. The threading of the harness is explained below the comber-board,
<i>l</i> and <i>m</i> indicating the leash-strings; and warp-threads 1, 2, 3, 4, from leashes 1, 2,
3, 4, are indicated as threaded.</p>

<p>384 times 4 divisions make 1536 warp-threads.</p>


<h3>XII. Tying-up of Jacquard Looms with Compound Harness attached.</h3>

<p>Tying-up of Jacquard looms with extra compound harness, consists in applying
two separate systems of harness in the loom. The warp-threads, after having
passed through the Jacquard harness, are passed through harness in front. Each
system of harness performs special duty, although they are both working the same
warp. The Jacquard harness is used for forming the general design on a large
scale; the second harness divides this pattern into detail, (twills, satins, or any
other desired weave). The above tie-up is necessary in the manufacture of rich
damasks and similar fabrics, where a large number of warp-ends is required, with a
correspondingly small number of picks per inch. Suppose a damask fabric to contain
300 ends warp per inch, with only 75 picks per inch; or in the proportion of 4 to 1.
Now, to employ this principle of making four ends warp equal to one filling, the
size of the design would be produced in the fabric, but the richness, and also the
fineness, of the face of the fabric would be entirely lost. To prevent this it should
be the object of the designer to keep the fine warp-threads entirely on the surface,
to interweave the proportion of ends varying between warp and filling (as in
example above, four warp-threads) separately. This principle of textures requires
the compound harness to be attached; or, in other words, a machine must be used
which is capable of raising not only every alternate thread, but every third, fourth,
or eighth thread, if required, for the formation of the body of the cloth.</p>

<p><a href="#FIGLXVI">Fig. LXVI.</a> illustrates as plainly as possible the principle of tying-up to do this
work, using a 100 Jacquard machine for figuring, comber-board threaded in three
divisions, four heddles to each leash, eight compound harnesses.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="FIGLXVI" id="FIGLXVI"></a><img src="images/i_059.jpg" width="600" height="546" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. LXVI.</span></div>
</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<a name="FIGLXVII" id="FIGLXVII"></a><img src="images/i_059a.jpg" width="150" height="262" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. LXVII.</span></div>
</div>

<p>In the tying-up of Jacquard harness four heddles to one leash are generally
used, as illustrated at <i>c</i>, in <a href="#FIGLXVI">Fig. LXVI.</a>; each heddle containing one warp-thread.
<a href="#FIGLXVII">Fig. LXVII.</a> shows the arrangement of these four warp-threads, when using only
one heddle to each leash, but in which the mail contains four eyes. This method
is less frequently employed. Instead of using a 100 machine, as in <a href="#FIGLXVI">Fig. LXVI.</a>,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p class="pclear">
A 200 machine (straight-through) will require &nbsp;&nbsp;800 warp-threads for each division.<br />
<span class="in2">300</span> machine (straight-through) will require 1200 warp-threads for each division.<br />
<span class="in2">400</span> machine (straight-through) will require 1600 warp-threads for each division.<br />
<span class="in2">600</span> machine (straight-through) will require 2400 warp-threads for each division.<br />
<span class="in2">900</span> machine (straight-through) will require 3600 warp-threads for each division.<br />
<span class="in1">1200</span> machine (straight-through) will require 4800 warp-threads for each division.<br />
</p>

<p>To change the tie-up principle from the straight-through method to the point
method, taking a 1200 machine using four heddles per harness-cord,
9600 warp-threads will be required for each division for repeat of
pattern.</p>

<p>This little example plainly shows the great advantage of this
method of tying-up looms for making the finest damasks, etc.</p>

<p>To explain the general method of this tie-up, commence with
<a href="#FIGLXVI">Fig. LXVI.</a>, which represents a 100 machine, three divisions, four
heddles to one leash, eight compound harnesses.</p>

<p>It will not be necessary to explain the threading of the comber-board, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
this is always done on the same plain principles. The four heddles of the first
row deep of comber-board emerge below the board at the beginning of the
first division, marked <i>a</i>, <i>a´</i>, <i>a´´</i>, <i>a´´´</i>. The first row deep in comber-board in the first
division, and the last row deep in comber-board in the third division only are shown;
but as these two rows also indicate the first and last rows in the Jacquard machine,
and as the principle of <i>a</i>, <i>a´</i>, <i>a´´</i>, <i>a´´´</i>, and <i>b</i>, <i>b´</i>, <i>b´´</i>, <i>b´´´</i>, has to be observed in every one
of these 75 rows deep in width of comber-board <i>E´</i> to <i>E´´</i> taken, it will explain the
tie-up for the entire number. At <i>c</i>, in leash <i>a</i>, four distinct heddles are adjusted;
the same thing is repeated in every one of the eight
leashes extended in drawing below the comber-board,
giving in return, thus: four heddles and three divisions
in a 100 machine = 4 × 3 × 100, or 1200 warp-threads
for the entire fabric.</p>

<p>Now, following the first heddle downwards on
leash 1, <i>a</i>, <i>c</i>, marked on drawing, <i>d</i>, (indicated by
dotted lines), No. 1 harness of the compound harness,
<i>H</i>, is reached. The cross <b>X</b> on this harness indicates
that the warp-thread drawn through mail fastened on
heddle, <i>d</i>, must also be drawn through No. 1 harness;
the next heddle from the same leash will reach No. 2
harness; and so on until No. 4 harness is taken up, which will finish No. 1 harness-cord
of No. 1 leash in the first division. The second harness-cord, <i>a´</i>, will use
harness 5, 6, 7, 8; the third harness-cord, <i>a´´</i>, will use harness 1, 2, 3, 4, over again,
as used by a; the fourth harness-cord, <i>a´´´</i>, will use harness 5, 6, 7, 8, over again, as
used by <i>a´</i>.</p>

<p>Continue in this manner until leash 100 in the first division on harness 5, 6, 7, 8,
is finished. The second and third divisions strictly repeat the first.</p>

<h3><i>The Kind of Heddles Required for Compound Harness.</i></h3>

<p>The eyes of these heddles are much longer than those of common heddles.
They must be sufficiently long to allow the six movements illustrated in <a href="#FIGLXX">Fig. LXX.</a> to
<a href="#FIGLXXV">LXXV.</a>, hence the height of these heddle eyes will influence the height of the shed.</p>


<h3><i>Working the Compound Harness by a Separate Machine.</i></h3>

<p>For working compound harness a separate small witch-loom is generally used,
thus saving, to a great extent, the Jacquard cards. In this manner the ground
may be easily altered without changing any cards, it being only necessary to change
the small set of cards on the witch-loom controlling one repeat of the body weave for
the harness. The number of picks for the harness can also be readily adjusted to
one change in the Jacquard figure without disturbing the cards of any consequence.
For example: in manufacturing a damask fabric, suppose four harness picks make
one change of figure in the Jacquard machine, and it is necessary to reduce these
four picks to one change of figure, on account of having to use some heavier filling,
or other similar reason; this alteration can be easily made when using two separate
machines.</p>

<a name="FIGLXXVI" id="FIGLXXVI"></a><img src="images/i_063.jpg" width="80" height="68" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The number of harness used is regulated by the weave required for raising, and
the weave required for lowering.</p>

<p>The number of harness may vary to a large degree, as we may
use any suitable weave from the 4-leaf twill up to the 16-leaf satin. As
a general rule, for fine damasks we use the 8-leaf satin, requiring 8
harness.</p>

<h3>XIII.&mdash;Tying-up Jacquard Looms for Gauze Fabrics.</h3>

<p>Gauze fabrics are produced by a separate system of weaves, which have the
peculiar characteristic of warp-threads not lying parallel to each other. One kind of
this warp is called the “douping warp” or “whip-threads;” these are twisted around
the ground-warp. The ground-threads, as well as the whip-threads, which work
together, must be drawn into one dent.</p>

<p>Jacquard gauze can be worked in various ways; for example: One whip-thread
against one or more ground-threads. More than one whip-thread against one or
more ground-threads.</p>

<p>There are two methods of tying-up for gauze fabrics: 1st. A tie-up in which the
doups are worked by one, two, three or four shafts in front of the Jacquard harness.
2d. A tie-up in which the gauze figuring is done all over the fabric, requiring each
doup to be arranged for working separately. If the ground-threads and whip-threads
are worked from the same Jacquard machine, the latter must be divided into two
sections: 1st section for the ground-threads with ground heddles; 2d section for the
whip-threads with standard heddles.</p>

<p>If a fabric contains the gauze in the form of a stripe, arranged one end ground
and one end whip, the same number of hooks are required for the ground and whip-threads
of each section, and an extra dead harness must be employed; but if this
arrangement of one end ground and one end whip must form figures, then the
ground and whip-threads must form the first section, and the whip-threads alone the
second section. In this case the second section requires only half as many hooks as
the first; and for the same reason, if we are forming figures with two ground-threads
and one whip-thread, the first section will contain three times as many hooks
as the second, etc. Very often two whip-threads are used for twisting, in which
case they must be drawn together in the doup. If several whip and ground-threads
are drawn into one reed they usually work independently at first on a regular weave;
following this is the gauze weave formed by a certain number of whip-threads raised
either on the left or right of the ground-threads contained in the same dent. This
movement brings into operation the second section of the machine containing the
harness-cords for the standard heddles. The technical terms for these various
combinations are: single-thread gauze, double-thread gauze, triple-thread gauze, etc.</p>

<p>The tie-up most generally used requires two-thirds of the needles for ground
heddles and one-third of the needles for standard heddles; hence, if using a 200
machine we find: 128 needles and hooks for the ground heddles, and 64 needles
and hooks for the standard heddles. [See <a href="#FIGLXXXVII">Fig. LXXXVII.</a>, p. 65.]</p>

</div>

<p>The comber-board is divided into two sections. The rear part (2/3) is used for
the ground, the front part (1/3) is used for the standard.</p>


<h4><i>Threading of the Harness.</i></h4>

<p>Thread the warp into the ground heddles in the same manner as a common
straight-through tie-up. Then take the first left-hand thread of the warp and draw
it through the doup. The next two warp-threads draw above the first one on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
left-hand side of the same doup. These three warp-threads must be drawn together
in one dent. After drawing the first pair in one dent, leave one, two, or more dents
empty, according to the fabric. The 4th, 5th and 6th warp-threads, also each
subsequent pair, are threaded the same as the first.</p>

<p class="pclear">These fourteen different movements cover all the possible changes in regular
weaving. The movement (7) illustrated in <a href="#FIG8">Fig. 8</a>, in addition to forming the regular
weave, is also necessary to the formation of the gauze weave.</p>

<p>These few explanations clearly show the great variety of effects possible for the

Modifications of the Single Lift Jacquard Machine.</h2>


<p>Having thoroughly described the construction and action of the regular
Jacquard machine, it now remains to illustrate and explain its modifications.
Among the most prominent are:</p>

<ul class="nostyle">
<li>1st. The Double Lift Single Cylinder Jacquard Machine.</li>

<li>2d. The Double Lift Double Cylinder Jacquard Machine.</li>

<li>3d. The Arrangement of Substituting “Tail-cords” in place of the Hooks, etc.</li>
</ul>


<h3>I. Double Lift Single Cylinder Jacquard Machine.</h3>

<p>The principle of this machine consists in raising the warp-threads any number
of times in succession without allowing the shed to close, thus performing the work
in nearly half the time, and with less wear and tear on the warp.</p>

<p><a href="#FIGXCVI">Fig. XCVI.</a> represents the sectional cut of one row across all the griffe-bars.
The machine selected for the illustration is of the 12-row type. Jacquard machines
of this description have two hooks to one needle; therefore in the drawing twenty-four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
hooks are represented. Two griffes are provided, each working every alternate
hook.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 306px;">
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. XCVI.</span></div>
<a name="FIGXCVI" id="FIGXCVI"></a><img src="images/i_068.jpg" width="306" height="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. XCVII.</span></div>
</div>

<p>In <a href="#FIGXCVI">Fig. XCVI.</a> the sectional cut of both griffes is shown, and in <a href="#FIGXCVI">Fig. XCVII.</a> the
top view of both griffes; the first set is represented shaded, the second black. The
former requires hooks Nos. 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11,
13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, and the latter Nos.
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24.</p>

<p>This arrangement permits either hook
to be lifted separately by the griffes, and a
corresponding elevation of the leash. As
these griffes work in opposition, one descends
while the other ascends; this motion
prevents the leash from dropping the entire
length of the cords, since the ascending griffe
catches it at half distance as the two griffes
pass each other. In this operation the shed
is never entirely closed, and a corresponding
gain in speed is attained. It will thus be
seen that the “double lift” single cylinder
has great advantages over the ordinary
machine. Of course, the warp-thread must
make its complete journeys up and down
when called for by the design; but when
once up, it need not be brought down until
absolutely required by the pattern. The
warp is thus subjected to less friction in working, and it is possible to use yarns
with less twist and obtain good results.</p>

<p>The advantages arising from not closing the shed may be seen in the following
example of a warp-thread working on an 8-leaf satin, in which seven picks are up in
succession.</p>

<p>By the single lift machine this warp-thread must travel seven times up and seven
times down, thus closing the shed absolutely seven times, with a corresponding wear
and tear. The double lift single cylinder arrangement does not require the warp-thread
to make these seven complete journeys to the “race-board” of the lay, but
instead it makes seven half trips. The saving may be shown by the following
analysis: Single lift machine, warp-thread, seven picks up in succession, in 8-leaf
satin (warp-face) requiring fourteen complete movements.</p>

<p>Double lift single cylinder machine requiring for the same effect:</p>

<h3>II. Double Lift Double Cylinder Jacquard Machine.</h3>

<p>The principle of this machine consists in the
combination of two separate Jacquard machines.
Two hooks (one of each machine) are connected
to one leash of the Jacquard harness, and as
each machine is operated alternately, a high
speed is attained, which is the purpose of the
machine. For example: 140 picks per minute (speed of loom) only requires 70
picks per minute from each part of the double lift double cylinder.</p>

<p>In <a href="#FIGCIII">Fig. CIII.</a> this is clearly illustrated. It shows two 12-row machines (<i>E</i> and
<i>F</i>) combined, thus giving 24 griffe-bars for the complete double machine, as the
griffes work within each other. As explained for double lift single cylinder, every
alternate bar is connected with a separate griffe, and these two griffes are worked
alternately on the same double lever arrangement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>These double lift double cylinder Jacquard machines are mostly used in the
manufacture of turkey-red goods and similar table-cover fabrics, using tie-ups
similar to the one illustrated below, which is a combination of the straight-through
and point tie-up, which may be alluded to once more by way of explanation in this
particular case.</p>

<p>The illustration represents a double lift double cylinder machine containing
two 600 machines, which equals an ordinary 600 machine for the tie-up.</p>

Tying-up of Jacquard Harness for Two-ply Ingrain Carpets.<br />

<span class="smcap">With a General Description of the Working of the Loom and
Construction of the Fabric.</span></h2>


<p>Two-ply Ingrain Carpet is an article composed of two fabrics, produced on
the regular double-cloth system. These two fabrics are arranged in the loom to
form figures by a simple exchanging of positions. A great variety of colors may
be put into each of these separate fabrics, (ground and figure), and the most
elaborate designs may be used. On every part of the carpet where these two
fabrics do not exchange, each works on the plain weave. The exchanging of these
two fabrics binds both into one, thus forming the ingrain carpet. In the manufacture
of this carpet four sets of warp-threads, and also four sets of filling-threads are
generally employed; but, if occasionally more or less should be used, in warp or in
filling, or in both, in the same fabric, the principle of exchanging is still observed.
If employing four sets in warp and
filling, two sets of each are used for
forming the figure, the other two sets
forming the ground, each of the
figure-threads having as its mate one
of the ground-threads. These threads
are so arranged that when a figure-thread
appears upon the face of the
fabric its mate appears upon the back, and when the figure-thread appears upon the
back the corresponding ground-thread appears upon the face.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 350px;">
<a name="FIGCVII" id="FIGCVII"></a><img src="images/i_072a.jpg" width="350" height="137" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. CVII.</span></div>
</div>

<p>To give a clearer understanding of the foregoing, a sectional cut of an Ingrain
carpet fabric is given in <a href="#FIGCVII">Fig. CVII.</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Suppose the filling-threads for the figure to be:</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Red</span>, indicated by heavy shaded circles; picks 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30.<br />
<span class="smcap">Black</span>, indicated by full black circles; picks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32.<br />
</p>

<p>And the filling-threads for the ground to be:</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">White</span>, indicated by empty circles; picks 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29.<br />
<span class="smcap">Olive</span>, indicated by light shaded circles; picks 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31.<br />
</p>

<p>A careful examination of the drawing shows that the white threads mate with the
red, and the black threads with the olive, so that when one of these colors shows
upon the face the mating color will show upon the back, and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>As a general rule, these warp-threads are of the same color as the weft-threads;
hence, every filling pick, appearing either on face or back, is bound by a warp-thread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
of the same color. The sectional cut represents four distinct effects with 32
picks, thus allowing 8 picks for the illustration of each part.</p>

<p>
1st effect, picks  1 to 8, is ground up (white and olive).<br />
2d&nbsp; effect, picks  9 to 16, is figure up (red and black).<br />
3d&nbsp;  effect, picks 17 to 24, is 1st effect in "<i>shot about</i>" (red and olive up).<br />
4th effect, picks 25 to 32, is 2d   effect in "<i>shot about</i>" (white and black up).<br />
</p>

<p>Two methods of tying-up Jacquard harness are in use:</p>

<p>
1st, the “straight-through” principle, (known to the trade as “cross-point”).<br />
2d, the “point” method, (known to the trade as “centre-tie”).<br />
</p>

</div>

<p><a href="#FIGCVIII">Fig. CVIII.</a>, p. 73, represents the arrangement
of the neck-cords with the heddles
(through the harness-cords). There are two
separate bottom boards in the machine,
marked <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, for ground and figure; also
two corresponding lifter-boards, which are
illustrated separately by <a href="#FIGCIX">Fig. CIX.</a></p>

<p>The four journals are clearly illustrated by
<a href="#FIGCX">Fig. CX.</a> (each journal carrying its own set of
threads).</p>

<p>
The first thread in the loom (left side) will be found on the first journal.<br />
The second thread in the loom (left side) will be found on the third journal.<br />
The third thread in the loom (left side) will be found on the second journal.<br />

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. CX.</span></div>
</div>

<p>This arrangement of threads, 1, 3, 2, 4, is repeated throughout the fabric. For
an example, a carpet is shown termed “extra fine,” executed on 26 “designs,”
requiring 26 × 8, or 208 small squares for warp on the designing paper. Ingrain
carpets are generally woven one yard wide, having in this width two repeats or
divisions; hence the number of harness-cords for the present example is as follows:
26 × 8 = 208 × 2, for ground and figure; 416 × 2, for two divisions, = 832
harness-cords (or 416 leashes) required for tying-up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. CXI.</span></div>
</div>

<p><a href="#FIGCXI">Fig. CXI.</a> illustrates the adjustment of heddle (mail) and lingo through the
journal, <i>J</i>, by means of the heavy knot at <i>b</i>. This knot must be large enough not
to pass through the hole of the journal. The average measures for the present
drawing are as follows:</p>

<p>
Lingo, &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>f</i> to <i>g</i>  =   9 inches.<br />
Heddle, <i>e</i> to <i>f</i> =   8 inches.<br />
<span class="wide6">&nbsp;</span><i>c</i> to <i>d</i> = 10 inches.<br />
Mail, <i>d</i> to <i>e</i><span class="wide">&nbsp;</span>= 6/8  inches.<br />
Height of journal, <i>b</i> to <i>c</i> = 1-1/8 inches.<br />
Connecting cord of heddle to harness-cord, <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> = 6 inches.<br />
</p>

<p>This drawing will explain the principle of raising the warp either
by means of the harness-board, (arrow 1), or by means of the knot
through raising the journal, (arrow 2). If raised by means of the
harness-cord, the connecting heddle slides upwards in the hole provided
for it in the journal; or the journal takes the place of a common
comber-board; but if the journal be used for raising, the knot, <i>b</i>, will
rise with it, carrying the heddle the same as before, the harness-cords
becoming slack by this movement.</p>

<p>In <a href="#FIGCVIII">Fig. CVIII.</a>, p. 73, the journals are arranged as follows:</p>

<table class="tablel" summary ="arrangement of journals">
<tr><td class="tdl">1st journal,</td><td class="tdc vm" rowspan="2">} for ground,{</td>
  <td class="tdr">White, 1st set of threads.</td>

<tr><td class="tdl">4th journal,</td><td class= "tdr"> Black, 4th  set of threads. </td></tr>
</table>

<p class="pclear">In the same drawing are also represented the first eight heddles
(in both divisions), as connected with harness-cords 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8;
also the last four heddles of the rear journal (fourth) connected with
their corresponding cords, 404, 408, 412, 416.</p>

<p>The first row (1 to 8) illustrates the principle of tying-up the
harness and the leasing of the heddles; whereas the four heddles in
the rear (404, 408, 412, and 416) show the practical commencement of the tie-up,
<i>i. e.</i>, four neck-cords in succession to four heddles of the journal.</p>

<p><i>A</i> represents bottom-board in the machine where the neck-cords for the ground
harness-cords pass through. <i>B</i>, the bottom-board in the machine where the neck-cords
for the figure harness-cords pass through.</p>

<p>In <a href="#FIGCIX">Fig. CIX.</a>, showing the lifter-boards, <i>A</i> is also used for the ground, and <i>B</i>
for the figure; 26 rows of the machine are shown for explaining the tie-up for a
texture known as “extra fine,” or equal to 832 heddles in the width of loom (one
yard).</p>

<p>Jacquard machines for two-ply ingrain carpets are usually constructed with 34
rows, and 33-1/2 of these are used. 33-1/2 rows have 33-1/2 × 8, or 268 needles, which
carry 1072 threads, the number actually used in what is termed a full “extra super.”
Should only 30 of these be used, having 30 × 8, or 240 needles, and carrying 960<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
threads for warp, the carpet is termed “super;” and if 25 rows, with 25 × 8 = 200
needles are used, carrying 800 threads, the product is called “fine” ingrain, and
represents about the lowest grade of these carpets. It frequently happens that we
find slight variations in the number of
threads used in the various grades of carpet
named. The pattern may require such a
change, or economy in production may induce
the maker to use a smaller number; or, as is
done in a few instances, a manufacturer may
always make his “extra super” on 32 rows;
but all such changes are done by a corresponding
depreciation of the value of the
fabric, as compared with a full “extra super” of 33-1/2 rows.</p>

<p><a href="#FIGCIX">Fig. CIX.</a>, p. 74, illustrates the full 34 rows, and indicates 26 rows used for
illustration of tie-up (4 rows
empty on each side). In
power-looms the raising of
the different journals is generally
accomplished by an
arrangement of cams, but in
hand-looms it is done by the
lifter-boards.</p>

<p>In <a href="#FIGCIX">Fig. CIX.</a> the four
large holes on each side are
made for this purpose, and
the wires for raising the
journals are shown by heavy
lines in tie-up in <a href="#FIGCVIII">Fig. CVIII.</a>,
p. 73. <a href="#FIGCXII">Fig. CXII.</a> represents
the process of lifting the
journals, as follows:</p>

<p>First pick raises lifter-board
<i>A</i>, journal 4; second
pick raises lifter-board <i>B</i>,
journal 1; third pick raises
lifter-board <i>A</i>, journal 3;
fourth pick raises lifter-board
<i>B</i>, journal 2.</p>

<p>The two positions of the
four “tails” in these four
picks are illustrated as follows:
<a href="#FIGCXIV">Fig. CXIII.</a>, hole in
cylinder; CXIV., no hole in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
cylinder. The black spots represent the knots, either as caught in the slot or passing
free in the hole.</p>

<p>Looms tied-up on the foregoing principles have but one operation of the
Jacquard needles for every two picks of the loom, there being an operation of the
ground and figure lifter-boards in succession between the operations of the Jacquard
needles. Each Jacquard needle controls two tails, one connected with the warp for
the figure, (red and black in our example), and the other to the warp for the ground,
(olive and white in our example). The drawing of the lifter-boards shows the slots
for catching the tails in opposite directions from each other; hence, when the figuring
tail of the needle is adjusted so as to be lifted by the figure lifter-board, the ground-tail
will not be acted on by the ground lifter-board when it rises.</p>

<p>To give a clear understanding of the foregoing explanations, a detailed statement
of the operations of the loom necessary in weaving a piece of the fabric is
shown in sectional cut <a href="#FIGCVII">Fig. CVII.</a>, as follows:</p>

<p>The beauty of an ingrain carpet consists in its color combination. In hand-looms
the common batten is used in connection with a shuttle which is somewhat
curved, a form most suitable to being thrown by the hand. The batten naturally
falls towards the weaver by its own gravity, being usually worked a little out of a
vertical line for that purpose. In this method the shed forms its own shuttle-race,
or bed upon which the shuttle slides. When two or more shuttles are used,
they are laid on the woven piece of
carpet before the weaver, and he
selects them as required. If a solid
shuttle-race is connected to the batten,
the warp-threads are pressed down
upon it and the shuttle slides upon
the ridge of the warp-threads. In
this case the “fly-shuttle” is used, and
also the “drop-box;” the latter being
operated by some of the reserve needles
of the Jacquard machine.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 374px;">

<p><a href="#FIGCXX">Fig. CXX.</a> shows a shuttle-box<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
mechanism for carpet hand-looms. As already stated, the four journals in power-looms
are lifted by cams or similar contrivances. In <a href="#FIGCXXI">Fig. CXXI.</a> (representing the
Crompton carpet loom) this cam arrangement is clearly visible; the cams are
situated above the journals, the latter being lifted by means of the journal rods
from above. The loom carries four shuttle-boxes at each end of the lathe; any
one of the series at either end can be brought into line with the shuttle-race at
any pick.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. CXXII.</span></div>
</div>

<p>In some looms the journals are also lifted from below, as shown in <a href="#FIGCXXII">Fig. CXXII.</a>,
representing the “Knowles” carpet loom. In this the journals are controlled by a
chain motion, instead of a cam, operating either journal at will, which can not be
done on a loom where the journals are actuated by cams. This permits the shading
of a fabric to be changed without cutting out the warp and re-drawing it. The box
mechanism (four boxes on each side of the lathe) is positive, and controlled by a
chain on the same shaft as the journals, and may be used with the chain alone, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
with the chain in combination with the cards. The motion can be run forward or
reversed at will, and any box called as desired.</p>

<p>Before closing this article, it is necessary to mention the method of working
the loom built with a stationary “shuttle-raceway” and an independent “comb,” the
latter having a reciprocating movement for beating up the filling, and a rising and
falling motion for bringing the comb up into, and taking it out of the warp; it has
also yielding racks and filling forks, and a cam so timed for operating the forks,
that the latter will seize the filling and carry it forward in front of the range of
the said comb.</p>

<p><a href="#FIGCXXIII">Fig. CXXIII.</a> illustrates the side view of the comb and its lay; also the parts
necessary to be shown for working the same: <i>k</i>, the independent lay; <i>d</i>, the
comb; <i>c</i>, the reed; <i>a</i>, its lathe; <i>b</i>, the shuttle-race; <i>c</i>, the breast beam of loom;

the lay, <i>k</i>; <i>n</i>, its fulcrum; <i>s</i>, grooved cam for working lever, <i>p</i>, <i>o</i>.</p>

</div>

<p class="pclear">The vibratory movement of the comb-lay for beating up the filling is produced
by the action of the cranks upon the toggle connections; and the upward and
downward movement of the lay, to produce the entrance of the comb into the warp
and its withdrawal therefrom, is produced by the action of the lever upon the
grooved cam. The comb, <i>d</i>, is constructed of teeth, which are secured together by
a bolt passing through them, and which have their bases of dovetail form to enable
them to be secured between a dovetail lip, on the lay, and a dovetail clamping plate,
secured to the lay by bolts.</p>

<p><a href="#FIGCXXIV">Fig. CXXIV.</a> illustrates the method of lifting the journals from below. The
journals, of which there are four, are arranged to work in upright fixed guides on
the loom framing, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>, and are operated by treadles, which are arranged in
pairs below, each journal being connected with one pair of treadles by two rods at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
its opposite ends. These treadles are operated by cams for each pair of treadles
and each journal.</p>

Preparing and Stamping of
Jacquard Cards.</h2>


<h4><i>Preparing.</i></h4>

<p>The Jacquard card consists of a strong, durable pasteboard cut to the exact
size of the cylinder. For cutting or preparing the cards to the required size, a table
is used with the different sizes of cards indicated on its surface. A sharp steel
blade is adjusted to the side of the table. A heavy knife of sufficient length, and
containing a second steel blade, is secured to a projecting bolt on the rear end of
the table, allowing enough play for the knife to be easily raised and lowered. The
blade of the knife works close against the blade fastened to the table; and when
pressed down both blades rest close together. On the front side of the table is a
long groove in which is a guide, fastened by a bolt and nut. This guide can be set
to suit any of the marks on the table, thus regulating
the size of the cards to be cut.</p>

<p>Two measures (the length and the width)
are required to be cut for each set of cards:
1st. The sheets of pasteboard are required
to be trimmed one way in sufficient number for
the length of the cards. 2d. Each trimmed sheet
is afterwards separated in strips of the required
width.</p>


<h4><i>Card Stamping.</i></h4>

<p>The oldest method for stamping cards, now
only occasionally used, consists of two perforated
steel plates, between which the blank cards are
placed, and the required holes stamped by hand
by means of punches. It will easily be seen that this method is not up to the
present advanced times, hence various machines have been introduced for arranging
the punches. Among those most generally used are:</p>

<h3>I. Dobby Card Punching Machines.</h3>

<p>These machines, illustrated by <a href="#FIG1">Fig. 1.</a>, (W. P. Uhlinger, builder), are used for
stamping cards for the smaller Jacquard machines, technically termed “Dobbies.”
They are of very compact build, and operated by belt-power. The whole card is
punched at one revolution or stroke. The rack on top of the machine holds the
design. The punches for peg-holes and lace-holes are immovable, while the key
punches act independently, at the will of the operator. Jacquard cards for these
machines are generally composed of the strongest pasteboard, and require a very
strongly constructed machine.</p>


<h3>II. Piano Card Stamping Machines.</h3>

<p>These are operated in two ways, by the belt or foot-power. There are two
kinds of each: “French index” and “American index.”</p>

holding the peg, <i>P</i>. Each punch works vertically, and is guided by a key for
stamping the hole.</p>

<p><a href="#FIG14">Fig. 14</a> illustrates the punch (actual size) as used in the “Royle” machine: <i>a</i>

<p><a href="#FIG15">Fig. 15</a> illustrates a corresponding key: diameter of key 3/16 inch, <i>d</i> to <i>e</i>;
diameter of head, 3/8 inch, <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>; <i>c</i> is the hole for inserting the pin which holds the
spring. The length of the keys vary from 1-3/4 to 2-1/8 inches, according to the
position they occupy in the machine. The punch and key of the Uhlinger machine
are shown (one-half of actual size) in Figs. <a href="#FIG4">4</a> and<a href="#FIG4"> 5</a>.</p>

<p><i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, in Figs. <a href="#FIG2">2</a> and <a href="#FIG13">13</a>, represent the piston for guiding the head in its
vertical motion.</p>

<p><a href="#FIG3">Fig. 3</a> represents the front view of the head. The numbers and letters
indicating the different parts correspond with <a href="#FIG2">Fig. 2</a>.</p>

<p>The principle of construction and action of the heads in both kinds of machine
are similar. Each key is provided with a fine spiral spring, which, after every action
of the key, returns it to its original position. The key for the peg-hole is controlled
by the larger spring, <i>S</i>, <i>D</i>, in Figs. <a href="#FIG2">2</a> and <a href="#FIG13">13</a>. The arrows in these two drawings
indicate the direction taken by the keys when under pressure.</p>

<p>When cutting cards eight rows deep, the thumb of the right hand works the
key for the peg-hole; the eight keys in the rear of the machine (which are the ones
to be used) are worked by the four fingers of each hand.</p>

<p>When cutting cards twelve rows deep, the eight keys in the rear are operated
by the eight fingers in the same manner; but the thumb of the right hand operates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
keys marked 1 and 2, and the thumb of the left hand operates keys marked 11
and 12.</p>

<p>During the cutting operation the fingers should not be removed from the keys;
they should always be in readiness to press the required key into action, as this is
the only way to become expert.</p>

<p>The eye of the card stamper must rest uninterruptedly on his design; and the
keys are called at will by the fingers, without the eye leaving the design, to find out
where a certain key or finger is situated at the time.</p>

<p>Two methods are employed for moving the carriage:</p>

<p>1st. By a “skipper” at its rear fastened to the carriage,
which moves in a rack of pins secured to the cutting table.
This method of construction is used by the Uhlinger machine.
Figs. <a href="#FIG6">6</a> and <a href="#FIG7">7</a> are front and side views of this mechanism.
Figs. <a href="#FIG8">8</a> and <a href="#FIG9">9</a>, the top view and sectional cut of the rack.</p>

<p>2d. The rack is fastened to the carriage, and the
skipper to the table, thus reversing the first method. [See
<a href="#FIG19">Fig. 19</a>, top view.] This method of construction is employed in the Royle machine.</p>

<p>The distance of the pins in the racks in both systems of construction (American
and French) corresponds to the distance of the rows in the card. The racks are
generally constructed for 600, 900, and 1200 Jacquard machines. Of these three
sizes the 1200 is the most advantageous, as cards can be cut for any smaller size
machine. The rack of a 900 machine (French index) contains 88 pins, while that
of a 1200 machine (French index) contains 114 pins.</p>

<p><a href="#FIG10">Fig. 10</a> illustrates the “catch” for holding the cards in the Uhlinger machine.
This is fastened to the carriage when pressed by the hand on top in the direction
of arrow, <i>S</i>; this catch will compress spring, <i>D</i>, in the direction of arrow, <i>S´</i>, thus
opening the “blade,” <i>C</i>, (front view shown by <a href="#FIG11">Fig. 11</a>), in the direction of arrow, <i>S´´</i>,
thus allowing the card to be inserted and held, securely fastened to the carriage.</p>

<p><a href="#FIG19">Fig. 18</a> illustrates the side view of the carriage and its catch for holding the
Jacquard card as used in the Royle machine. Arrow, <i>S</i>, indicates the pressure
of the operator’s hand on lever, <i>B</i>, when the card is inserted. This lever presses
by means of presser, <i>D</i>, in the direction of arrow, <i>S´</i>, on the double-acting lever, <i>E</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
at <i>c</i>. This lever moving around its fulcrum, <i>e</i>, will lift catch, <i>F</i>, in the direction of
arrow, <i>S´´</i>, thus allowing the card to be inserted. Spring, <i>G</i>, fastened to main part

carriage wheels, of which there are four.</p>

<p><a href="#FIG19">Fig. 19</a> represents the top view of <a href="#FIG19">Fig. 18</a>, and is designed to show the
arrangement of levers, wheels, and catches of the complete rack as used for a 900
machine. The letters indicating the different parts correspond with the ones used
in <a href="#FIG19">Fig. 18</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#FIG16">Fig. 16</a> shows top view and ground plan, and <a href="#FIG17">Fig. 17</a> the front elevation of the
“card-guide,” as constructed on the Royle machine. It is universal and self-adjusting
to any width of cards from 3/4 to 3-1/2 inches; both guide-plates, <i>C</i> and <i>D</i>,
are caused to move equally toward
or away from the peg-punch, thus
accurately centering the peg-hole in
all cards.</p>

<p>Letters <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>P</i>, and numbers
1 to 12, correspond to those used
in <a href="#FIG13">Fig. 13.</a> <i>E</i>, <i>F</i>, <i>H</i>, <i>K</i>, are the
three levers moving around pin, <i>G</i>,
(the latter in even line with the
centre of the peg-hole, <i>P</i>). These
levers are held by screw, <i>L</i>, in any
required position. Spring, <i>S</i>, holds
lever, <i>F</i>, <i>H</i>, against pin, <i>T</i>, which
in turn is fastened to the same plate
as screw, <i>L</i>.</p>

<p><a href="#FIG16">Fig. 16</a> indicates the card-guide
set for a 12-row card. Let us suppose
it necessary to cut an 8-row
card. Loosen screw, <i>L</i>, and spring,
<i>S</i>, will instantly contract until each
side of the guide has moved the required
distance (two holes and two
spaces between holes) towards the
centre. Much valuable time is saved
by the use of this guide, as it instantly adjusts itself to any width of card, and at the
same time centralizes each card passed through the machine. In factories where
broken cards require to be constantly renewed, the value of this guide is especially
noticeable, there being no material interruption of the regular work of the operator,
who can replace the damaged card at the moment wanted.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 20.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Letters indicating the different parts in <a href="#FIG17">Fig. 17</a>, correspond to those used in
<a href="#FIG16">Fig. 16</a>. As mentioned before, the pistons, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, of the cutting head are connected
below the table to the cutting levers, and by a simple combination of levers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the cutting pedal is brought in direct relation to the cutting lever; all of which are
illustrated in the perspective view of the Royle machine in <a href="#FIG20">Fig. 20</a>, and the Uhlinger
machine in <a href="#FIG12">Fig. 12</a>. The working of the cutting pedal is very simple. Pressing
the pedal, situated at the right, causes the punch head to descend, and the punch
penetrates the card. Transferring the pressure from the right to the left pedal raises
the punch-head to its former position, (punches above card), ready for a repetition of
these movements. The “skip” arrangement allows the carriage to advance the
distance from one pin to the other in the
card-rack, thus placing the card in proper
position under the punches.</p>

<p>At the proper height above the punch-head
is the reading-board, on which the
guide-rules are moved across the design
by screws, which are connected by gearing
and operated by means of the hand-wheel
or crank shown on the lower side of the
board. As drawing-pins or thumb-tacks
are generally used as fastenings for the
design, the reading-board is made of soft
wood, and its trimmings are made of hard
wood.</p>

<p><a href="#FIG21">Fig. 21</a> illustrates the Uhlinger Card Stamping Machine
operated by belt-power. Being the same in principle as the foot-power
machine, it is only necessary to state that instead of working
the machine by means of the cutting pedals, it is done
automatically by simply touching any of the keys that operate
the punches; thus the machine makes one stroke and punches
the required holes.</p>


<h3>The Stamping of Cards.</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 159px;">
<a name="FIG22" id="FIG22"></a><img src="images/i_091a.jpg" width="159" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 22.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Before commencing this work a clear conception of the tie-up
and leasing of the heddles is required. The holes in the cards for
the needles to penetrate, or the spots in cards where no hole is to
be stamped, must be arranged in an uninterrupted chain from one row to the other,
until all the rows are taken up. As previously mentioned, the method observed
in tying-up the loom is the guide for stamping the cards. The number of ends required
in a certain design may repeat only once in the number of hooks and needles
employed in the Jacquard machine; or they may repeat two, three, or more times.</p>

card, (French index), one-fourth of its actual size, for the first pick. In a
200 machine this design will repeat itself five times. The lace-holes and the peg-holes
are blank. The reserve row (26th) is shaded, and the design as cut in card is
indicated by black dots. This cut also shows the direction of reading each row to
correspond with the numbering for the punch-heads, in Figs. <a href="#FIG2">2</a>, <a href="#FIG3">3</a>, <a href="#FIG13">13</a>, and card-guide
in <a href="#FIG16">Fig. 16</a>. The numbers 1 to 40, 41 to 80, 81 to 120, 121 to 160, 161 to 200, indicate
the direction of stamping the design, as well as the five repeats to form the complete
card. In this connection it will be of great advantage to
examine <a href="#FIGXXIX">Fig. XXIX.</a>, p. 28, under the head of the Jacquard
Machine and its Tie-ups.</p>

for “extra fine.” The 26 rows needed are shown full black,
and marked to correspond. The peg-holes and lace-holes
are left blank. In the other texture, or what is termed
“extra super” ingrain carpet, the additional rows are represented
by the shaded holes at the ends of the cards. Arrow,
<i>S</i>, indicates the direction for commencing to read off each
row.</p>


<h3>III. Repeating Jacquard Pattern Cards by the Positive Action
Repeater.</h3>

</div>

<p>If several sets of cards of one design are required for
starting a corresponding number of looms, and the first set
has been produced by the “piano machine” exact duplicates
can easily be obtained at small cost to the manufacturer by
the “Repeating Machine.” This machine is built by Messrs.
John Royle &amp; Sons, Paterson, N. J., and is illustrated by <a href="#FIG25">Fig.
25</a> in a perspective view.</p>

<p><a href="#FIG26">Fig. 26</a>, p. 94, represents the front elevation of the throat-piece
through which the cards that are to be cut pass, the carriage
on which it is supported, and the mechanism employed
for imparting a rising and falling motion to the carriage.</p>

<p><a href="#FIG27">Fig. 27</a>, p. 95, is a vertical longitudinal section of the
upper portion of the machine.</p>

<p><a href="#FIG28">Fig. 28</a>, p. 95, gives a perspective view in detail of portions
of a selecting-needle and key-wire and a lever connecting
them.</p>

<p><a href="#FIG29">Fig. 29</a>, p. 95, gives a view in detail of the mechanism
employed to turn the pattern cylinder.</p>

<p>The cards to be duplicated (<i>N</i>, <i>N</i>, <a href="#FIG26">Fig. 26</a>, p. 94,) are
arranged upon the card race-arms (<i>M</i>, <i>M</i>, <a href="#FIG26">Fig. 26</a>,) in the same manner as upon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
loom. The uncut or blank cards, having been previously laced together, (<i>E</i>, <i>E</i>,
<a href="#FIG26">Fig. 26</a>), are piled in the rear at the base of the column, and thence passed forward
through the machine, and delivered finished in front.</p>

<p>The perforating of the cards is performed by a vertically reciprocating die,
(<i>D</i>, <a href="#FIG26">Fig. 26</a>), and a set of punches (<i>C</i>, <a href="#FIG26">Fig. 26</a>,) carried in a fixed punch-head, and
capable of being pushed upward when such movement is not prevented. The cards
commonly used are of a size to receive 600 holes, and hence that number of punches
are required.</p>

<p>The cards (<i>E</i>) to be cut are drawn over a “reel” or “idler” (<i>F</i>, <a href="#FIG26">Fig. 26</a>,) at
the back of the machine, and thence pass through openings in the base frame to the
front of the machine, and over a square cylinder having a step-by-step rotary motion.
By each quarter turn of this cylinder, the chain of cards is drawn forward sufficiently
to bring a new card in the die. By the rising movement of the die (carriage), which
takes place as soon as the intermittent feed of the cards has ceased, the card
in the throat of the machine is carried up against the lower ends of the punches, and
is cut or perforated by all such punches as have their upward movement prevented
by the keys; while such punches as are not arrested by the keys are carried upward,
and do not puncture the card. The pieces of card cut off fall through a throat or
opening in the carriage (<i>F</i>, <a href="#FIG27">Fig. 27</a>,) into the hollow base frame, (<i>A</i>, <a href="#FIG27">Fig. 27</a>), and
can be taken out at the door, (<i>A</i>, <a href="#FIG26">Fig. 26</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>It will therefore be apparent that the variations in the cards are produced simply
by holding down different punches in successive punching operations. This is
regulated by the original set of cards, (<i>N</i>, <a href="#FIG26">Fig. 26</a>), which are passed over the
pattern cylinder (<i>O</i>, <a href="#FIG26">Fig. 26</a>). The latter has also a step-by-step rotary motion
similar to the cylinder first described. Its four faces are covered with holes the same
distances apart as the perforations in the pattern cards. This pattern cylinder is
mounted in bearings in a carriage on the top of the machine, and is reciprocated back
and forth between the successive rotary movements of the feed and pattern cylinders.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="FIG26" id="FIG26"></a><img src="images/i_094.jpg" width="600" height="504" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 26.</span></div>
</div>

<p>In the upper part of the machine are arranged what are termed selecting
needles, (<i>C</i>, <a href="#FIG27">Fig. 27</a>), which consist of wires arranged in horizontal rows, with their
ends opposite to the pattern cylinder, and which are the same distance apart as the
holes in the cylinder, so that if the cylinder were moved up by the carriage against
the ends of the needles, the latter would enter the holes in the cylinder, and would
not be moved longitudinally. There are the same number of selecting needles as
punches in the machine&mdash;six hundred. When, however, a perforated pattern card
is on the cylinder, and it is moved against the ends of the selecting needles, such
needles as are opposite the perforations of the cards will enter them, and will not be
moved, while such needles as are opposite the blank spaces of the cards will be
moved longitudinally. [See <a href="#FIG27">Fig. 27</a> for illustration.] At the reverse movement of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
carriage, an “evener,” which is secured to it at the end opposite the pattern cylinder,
strikes against the ends of all the needles so moved and pushes them back to their
original position. Above each of the punches before described is a horizontal sliding
key (<i>D</i>, <a href="#FIG27">Fig. 27</a>,) attached to a horizontal key-wire (<i>D´</i>, <a href="#FIG27">Fig. 27</a>), and the 600 key-wires
are arranged in horizontal rows below the selecting needles, and are each
connected by a lever (<i>B</i>, <a href="#FIG27">Fig. 27</a>,) with the corresponding selecting needle.
Consequently, a longitudinal motion of any selecting needle will move the key-wire
with which it is connected in a reverse direction.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="FIG27" id="FIG27"></a><img src="images/i_095.jpg" width="600" height="425" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 27.</span></div>
</div>

<p><a href="#FIG28">Fig. 28</a> gives a clear demonstration of the connection of a selecting needle, <i>c</i>,
to the key-wire, <i>f</i> by means of the lever, <i>e</i>, movable around the fixed pin, <i>d</i>. Each
key (<i>D</i>, <a href="#FIG27">Fig. 27</a>,) consists of a cylindrical plug of metal, which, projecting over a
punch, forms an abutment to keep that punch from rising, but if withdrawn, allows
the punch to rise without resistance.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<a name="FIG28" id="FIG28"></a><img src="images/i_095a.jpg" width="100" height="178" alt="" />

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 29.</span></div>
</div>

<p>A step arrangement of the punches and keys is
adopted; that is, the upper ends of the outer rows of
punches are highest and the punches in the several
rows decrease in height till the inner row is reached,
where the punches are the lowest. Hence, the keys
of the upper rows, which correspond to the outer rows
of punches, are carried over the inner rows of punches
and terminate over the punches in the outer rows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Normally, all the keys are above the punches, and all would punch when the die
ascends, but when a pattern card is carried by the pattern cylinder against the ends
of the selecting needles, certain needles are moved and produce a reverse movement
of the corresponding key-wires, and draws certain keys out of reach of their punches;
no resistance being offered to the upward movement of such punches, they do not
perforate the cards.</p>

<p>The carriage on which the pattern cylinder is carried being mounted directly on
the top of the machine, can be readily lifted off to afford access to the parts below,
and it is provided with a movable hood, which may be lifted to inspect the selecting
needles.</p>

<p>The keys and key-wires are arranged farther apart vertically than the selecting
needles, thus enabling larger keys and heavier and stronger key bearings to be used,
and avoiding any liability of the punches striking the keys in the tier next above
when those of their own tier are withdrawn.</p>

<p>Instead of applying a separate spring to each punch to move it downward or
return it as the die recedes, a positively operated returning plate is used, which
moves down as the die recedes and acts on collars on the punches, [see <i>d</i>, <a href="#FIG27">Fig. 27</a>],
and forces all the punches down. This is very important, for if any of the punches
should fail to descend, the movement of their keys would be prevented, and thereby
the machine would fail to properly repeat.</p>

<p>The bearings of the pattern cylinder are so constructed that the cylinder can
be instantly changed to allow either a 400 or a 600-hole cylinder to be used, so that
the bearings can be adjusted to adapt them for either size cylinder.</p>

<p>The bearings of the feed cylinder, whereby the chain of cards to be cut is
moved, are constructed and supported so as to enable them to be readily adjusted
to suit slight variations in the tightness with which the cards are laced, or in a
greater degree to suit large or small cards, and the mechanism whereby the
cylinder is operated is capable of ready adjustment for the same purpose.</p>

<p>It is well known that the punching of a great number of holes simultaneously,
even in cardboard, requires great power, and entails enormous shock and great wear
on the machine; to obviate this difficulty, the punches are slightly varied in length
relative to their keys, so that they will not all act on the cards at exactly the same
instant, and the strain on the machine and power required are thereby greatly
reduced.</p>


<h4 class="center"><i>A Lace-Hole Press</i></h4>

<p>Is indispensable to the machine. This is a separate little machine, designed to set
upon a bench or table, and is used especially for cutting the peg and lace-holes. It
may be operated very readily by hand, but if desired, is easily adapted to run by
power. The feeding is done by one motion of the hand, and once handling of the
card; the cards leave the press by gravitation, and arrange themselves in piles.
The press is arranged to cut cards for 400 or 600 machines.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Lacing_of_Cards" id="The_Lacing_of_Cards"></a>The Lacing of Cards.</h2>


<p>Two methods are observed for lacing Jacquard cards: <i>A</i>, hand-lacing on a
common frame; <i>B</i>, lacing by power.</p>


<h3>A. Lacing of Jacquard Cards by Hand.</h3>

<p>For this purpose the cards are put on a common frame containing on its surface
pegs of a corresponding size to those used on the cylinder. The pegs on the frame
are made of hard wood, and the pegs of the cylinder of brass. These pegs on the
frame are located at exact distances apart, and the frames are built to hold from 30
to 50 cards, superficially arranged.</p>

<p>Figs. <a href="#FIG30">30</a> and <a href="#FIG30">31</a> illustrate the frame under <i>S</i>, showing at <i>a</i> three cards arranged
for a fabric, with a twill effect from left to right; and at <i>b</i> the same cards
arranged for a twill in the opposite direction, from right to left. These frames are
arranged to slide into each, so as to adapt them to the distances of the peg-holes in
the cards. To give a clear understanding as to the distance of these pegs from
each other a few measures most generally used for lacing frames are given.</p>

<p>The centre of the pegs are 2-9/16´´ apart. Width of cards 2-5/16´´, allowing 1/4´´
for distance between the cards. Diameter of the pegs at the bottom, 3/8´´. Distance

<h3>B. Lacing of Jacquard Cards by Machine.</h3>

<p>Different styles of machines are constructed for doing this work, among which
we find machines requiring two needles for each series of holes in the Jacquard
cards, and machines using one shuttle in connection with each needle. The
Jacquard cards mostly needed are for machines containing 400, 600, etc., hooks and
needles.</p>

<p>The Jacquard cards for these sizes have three series of lace-holes, and the
number of needles, or needles and shuttles, used in the machine, is proportionally
increased.</p>


<h4><i>The Method of using Two Needles for Lacing each Series of Holes</i></h4>

<p>Is the one most extensively employed, hence we will take this machine (W. P.
Uhlinger, Phila., builder,) for the subject.</p>

cards. The table is located at a convenient height, and is 33-1/2 by 36-1/2 inches.
Two grooves, each 1-1/16 inches by 26-1/2 inches, are located five inches from front and
rear respectively, and 9-1/8 inches from each side. A third groove of the same size
is situated in the centre, 6-1/32 inches from the others. An endless chain runs in each
groove, consisting of 24 links, corresponding in length to the width of the card to be
laced. Each link of the two outside chains has a peg of a size corresponding to the
one used on the cylinder in the Jacquard machine.</p>

<p>Two needles are required for each of the three series of lace-holes, or six

they are operated correspondingly. The three vertical working needles are arranged
in the same manner, and also the three loop-guides.</p>

<p>Two different sets of lacing twines
are used, viz.:</p>

<p>1st. Set of fine thread running from three spools shown in a vertical
position on the side of the machine, used for threading the needles
running in a horizontal direction. In our explanation we denote this
twine with “<i>a</i>.” (7-ply, No. 14 soft laid mule yarn.)</p>

<p>2d. The set of heavy twine running from spools arranged horizontally
near the bottom in rear of machine is threaded to the vertical
needles. This twine is indicated by “<i>b</i>” in our explanations. (No. 24
braid banding.)</p>

<p>In <a href="#FIG38">Fig. 38</a>, arrow, <i>e</i>, illustrates the twine, “<i>a</i>,” as coming off the
spools. On the bottom of the “holder” is an extension which is separately
illustrated in its front view by <a href="#FIG40">Fig. 40</a>. This extension contains
a pin marked <i>k</i>, which guides the twine into the hole, <i>l</i>; (<i>e</i> and arrow in <a href="#FIG38">Fig. 38</a> correspond

</div>

<p>The position of this twine in working is shown in <a href="#FIG38">Fig. 38</a>. <i>C</i>, the crossing of the
two twines preparatory to forming the loop, is illustrated. The mechanical construction
is such that needle, <i>a</i>, is withdrawn from loop at the same time needle, <i>b</i>,
commences to rise, placing the twines in position shown in <a href="#FIG41">Fig.
41</a>. Needle, <i>b</i>, will in turn pull down as soon as needle, <i>a</i>, is
ready for moving forward. By moving needle, <i>b</i>, down, its twine
will form a loop, [see <a href="#FIG42">Fig. 42</a>], held in its position by the “loop-guide,”
<a href="#FIG37">Fig. 37</a>. Through this loop, needle, <i>a</i>, is again inserted.
Needle, <i>b</i>, will leave the card below as soon as needle, <i>a</i>, is in its
loop. At this juncture the cards will be moved by means of the
catch and chain of links one hole or one space between cards,
whichever may be required. After this is done, needle, <i>b</i>, will
rise in its new place, and at the same time needle, <i>a</i>, commences
its backward journey through the loop shown and explained in
Figs. <a href="#FIG38">38</a> and <a href="#FIG41">41</a> at the beginning; thus ready for a repetition of
the two movements.</p>

swings around pin, <i>T</i>, and gets its motion from rod, <i>U</i>, <i>V</i>, <i>W</i>.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 44.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The Jacquard cards are placed on the machine at <i>B´</i>, and move in rotation
under needle, <i>Z</i>. The movement of the cards must be so regulated that, notwithstanding
the want of uniformity in the arrangement of the holes, each hole in turn
must come directly under the lacing needles.</p>

<p>The lacing of the cards is produced as follows: After the cards have moved
one hole, the needles, <i>Z</i>, lower to <i>P´</i>, <a href="#FIG43">Fig. 43</a>, making the shed. The shuttles move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
with their points under the thread thus lowered by the needle, and pass clear
through the loop. After the needles rise, they will in turn tighten the loop, the
shuttles return to their original position, and the work repeats.</p>

<p>This method of lacing Jacquard cards has the disadvantage of compelling the
machine to be stopped oftener than if using the two-needle system (<a href="#FIG32">Fig. 32</a>), as the
shuttles will only hold a small quantity of lacing twine.</p>

<span class="f75">TO</span><br />

LEARNERS OF JACQUARD DESIGNING.</h2>


<p>Designers for Jacquard work, in addition to being good draughtsmen, must be
thoroughly acquainted with the three systems of weaves: plain, twills and satins,
and their sub-divisions; also with the structure of double cloth, three-ply cloth, four-ply
cloth, etc. He must know the influence of the texture upon the weaves and the
fabric; the arrangement of the threads in the dents of the reed; the different
systems of tying-up the Jacquard harness; and the stamping of the Jacquard
cards for the various kinds of textile fabrics.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="Squared_Designing_Paper_for_the_Different_Textile_Fabrics" id="Squared_Designing_Paper_for_the_Different_Textile_Fabrics"></a>
Squared Designing Paper for the Different Textile Fabrics
Executed on the Jacquard Machine.</h2>


<p>The classifying of the □ designing paper is done by enclosing a number of small
rectangles, horizontal and vertical, within a certain distance by a heavy line. Such
enclosures are known in practice as “squares.” The spaces between the vertical
lines indicate the warp-threads, and those between the horizontal lines the filling
threads. As a rule the warp dimension is indicated first; and a design paper having
five rectangles vertical with ten horizontal, is variously read and indicated as 5 by 10,
5 × 10, or 5/10.</p>

<p><a href="#FIG46">Figs. 46 to 68</a> represent some of the styles of □ designing paper most frequently
used. The size of the square may vary in each kind of paper, and must be selected
according to the fabric to be sketched. For example: There are three styles of
8 × 8 □ designing paper in general use: One forming 1/2 inch heavy squares, (<a href="#FIG46">Fig.
48</a>), one forming 3/4 inch heavy squares, (<a href="#FIG46">Fig. 64</a>), and the other forming 1 inch
heavy squares. These sizes may still be varied.</p>

<p>The principle of these three kinds of □ designing paper is identical, the size
preferred being left to the pleasure of the designer. If a design is to be made for a
great number of needles, say 600, 900, 1200, etc., it will be best to use the smallest
size; whereas in a design for only 100 to 200 needles the larger sizes may be
employed.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>


<h3>Practical Use of the Heavy Square in Designing Paper.</h3>

<p>The heavy square serves as a unit of measurement, as well as a means of
calculation, and shows readily and exactly the size of the design. The eye becomes
accustomed to grasping the meaning of this large square, and comprehends at a
glance the situation. For instance:</p>

<p>On 8 × 8 paper, 25 squares means 8 × 25, or 200 rectangles each way. 10 ×
10 paper, 10 × 25, or 250 rectangles each way. 10 by 12 paper, 10 × 25,
or 250 rectangles one way, and 12 × 25, 300 rectangles the other way.</p>

<p>These rectangles in actual work represent threads or ends, thus:</p>

<p>
200 ends on  8 ×  8  paper require 25 squares.<br />
300 ends on  10 × 10 paper require 30 squares.<br />
450 ends on  10 × 12 paper require 45 squares one way, and 450 ÷ 12, or 37 squares + 6 lines the other way.<br />
</p>

<p>The squares will also assist in putting the weave in a design. For example:
Suppose a design for a damask table-cover is required, having for weaves the 8-leaf
satin. By using the 8 by 8 paper the “risers” or “sinkers” of the 8-leaf satin are
found in the same place in each square, thus any error in forming the weave is at
once detected. Sometimes more than one square is required for ascertaining this
fact; suppose in the preceding example the □ paper to be 10 by 10, then the number
of threads represented by four successive squares = 4 times 10, or 40, being five
repeats of the 8-leaf satin, as 5 times 8 = 40.</p>


<h3>Selection of Designing Paper for Single Cloth.</h3>

<p>For single cloth the character of the designing paper is ascertained by the
number of warp and filling threads required per inch in the finished fabric. For
example: A damask fabric with a texture, when finished, of 80/120 (80 ends warp and
120 picks filling per inch) will require a designing paper of corresponding proportion,
or as 80 is to 120, = 8 × 12.</p>

<p>In stripes, checks, etc., the texture in part of the fabric is changed; such changes
require separate designs. If the difference is only slight, one kind of paper is
used. Select the paper derived through the proportion of the two as required. For
example: A dressgoods fabric forming two distinct effects in one repeat of 400
warp-threads (200 successive ends required for each effect).</p>

<p>
The first  effect made on a texture 60/80.<br />
The second  effect made on a texture 80/80.
</p>

<p>Two distinct designs (one for each effect) are required:</p>

<p>
For the first  effect use a paper proportioned as 60 to 80, or 6 × 8.<br />
For the  second effect use a paper proportioned as 80 to 80, or 8 × 8.
</p>

<p>If only one kind of □ designing paper be used for both effects, find the average
of the warp, thus: 6 + 8 = 14, and 14 ÷ 2 = 7, showing that paper 7 × 8 is the
substitute. If using a designing paper under similar circumstances the sketch must
be squared to correspond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>


<h3>Selection of Designing Paper For Double Cloth.</h3>

<p>In fabrics where one line (visible across the face) is produced by two or more
different colored threads, (each pick forming part face, part body or back of the
fabric), the designing paper to be used is shown by the proportion of the line effects
to the warp-threads (figure) per inch. Example: Take a dress-goods fabric, extra
figured in the filling, having the following texture: Warp, 60 ends per inch; filling,
100 picks per inch, double system, 1 pick for ground, 1 pick for figure. The paper
required is as 60:(100 ÷ 2) or as 60:50 = 12 × 10, or 6 × 5.</p>

<p>The figure is painted upon the paper in various colors and by the card-stamping
when cutting the ground cards. The extra colors are treated as if they were ground.
When cutting for the extra figure, deal with it alone.</p>

<p>If a fabric has the double-cloth system applied to the warp, only using one filling
for both kinds of warp, and the Jacquard-harness is tied-up for “single sections,” the
squared designing paper required is found from the proportion of the number of
face and back warp-threads per inch, to the number of picks per inch. Example:
Take a dressgoods fabric constructed on the following texture: 80 ends warp, 1 end
ground, 1 end figure, and 60 picks to 1 inch. The proportion for the paper is as 80:60,
or 8 × 6 designing paper.</p>

<p>If the tie-up in the loom is for double sections, (<a href="#FIGLIV">Fig. LIV.</a> or <a href="#FIGLVI">LVI.</a>), the fabric in
the previous example requires the comparison of the face-warp with the filling, and
the answer is: 80 ÷ 2 or 40 ends of face-warp per inch, 60 picks filling per inch,
giving the proportion of 40 to 60, requiring 8 × 12, or 4 × 6 designing paper for the
figure. The ground part of the design is executed separately on the same kind of
paper; or if the weave is of a short repeat, stamped without design.</p>

<p>In selecting the □ designing paper for double cloth, such as cloakings, coatings,
etc., made with a back-warp, and executed on any of the single section tie-ups, use
the lines between the squares to indicate the back-warp and back-filling. The
proportion of ends of face-warp to face-filling in one inch of the finished fabric
indicates the kind of paper needed.</p>

<p>Example: If a fabric has the following texture:</p>

<p>
Warp,    2 ends face, 1 end back,  90 ends per inch.<br />
Filling, 3  ends face,  1 end back,   132 picks   "<br />
</p>

<p>The kind of designing paper needed is found by dividing 90 by 3, and
multiplying by 2, thus: 90 ÷ 3 × 2 = 60, number of ends of face-warp per inch, and
132 ÷ 4 × 3 = 99, number of picks filling per inch, giving a 60 × 99 paper, or its
equivalent, 6 × 10.</p>

<p>Face cards for these fabrics must be stamped twice, first for the face weave,
and afterward for the binder. If using a 12-row machine, use punches 1, 2, 4, 5, 7,
8, 10, and 11, for face; 3, 6, 9, and 12, for the back of the fabric.</p>


<h3>Selection of Designing Paper for Two-ply Ingrain Carpets.</h3>

<p>Always observe the proportion existing between the number of warp and filling-threads.
For instance, take a carpet having 1072 ends warp (536 ground and 536<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
filling) per yard, with 30 picks per inch (1 pick ground and 1 pick filling, or 15 pair).
Then, 1072 ÷ 36 = 29-28/36 ends of warp per inch. The proposition is as 29-28/36: 30; or,
what is practically the same, 30: 30, showing that the paper must be equally divided,
and 8 × 8 may be used, as is usually done.</p>

<p>Again, take a carpet having 832 ends warp (416 ground, 416 figure) per yard
with 20 picks per inch (1 pick ground, 1 pick figure, or 10 pair). Then 832 ÷ 36 =
23-4/36, and the proportion is as 23-1/9: 20, or as 7-19/27: 6-2/3, practically 8: 7; and 8 × 7
paper may be used.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;It will always be advantageous for the card stamping if the designing paper be selected so that the number of
warp-ends in one square equals the number of griffe-bars used in the Jacquard machine.</p></blockquote>


<h3>Selection of the Proper Brush for the Different □ Designing Papers.</h3>

<p>The brush used by the designer must be clipped according to the size of the
rectangles of the paper. It should cover the rectangle in warp direction at one
sweep of the hand; hence each size of the squared paper requires a specially
prepared brush for quick, good, and perfect work.</p>


<h3>Colors used For Painting Textile Designs.</h3>

<p>For this purpose take common colors (in powder), and mix with water and
mucilage to avoid rubbing off after application. Use no more mucilage than
necessary, as too much will be followed by slow and imperfect work. Colors
mixed in this manner must be kept moist by adding a few drops of water daily.
The colors most generally used for painting textile designs are:</p>

<p class="in4">
Vermilion.<br />
Lamp Black.<br />
White Lead.<br />
Emerald Green.<br />
Chrome Yellow.<br />
Burnt Umber.<br />
Cobalt Blue.<br />
Carmine, etc.<br />
</p>

<p>A few drops of alcohol will greatly assist the mixing of vermilion, umber, and
similar colors which have no affinity for water. Chloride of lime is used on colors
having a vegetable basis (as carmine, etc.,) for correcting imperfections, applying
weaves or changes in the colored part of a design.</p>

<p>If the designing paper becomes greasy, the colors will not adhere. To cure
this take a moist sponge and wipe off the paper.</p>


<h3>Preservation of Textile Designs.</h3>

<p>To prevent textile designs (painted on the □ designing paper) from being soiled,
apply a thin solution of white shellac varnish, which dries almost instantaneously.
A design preserved in this manner can be cleaned off at any time with a wet sponge,
and after years have passed will appear bright and distinct.</p>

Sketching of Designs for Textile Fabrics to be Executed on
the Jacquard Machine.</h2>


<p>The first work to be done in making an <i>original</i> design, or in reproducing a
design by making an <i>analysis</i> of a woven fabric, is to prepare the “<i>sketch</i>.” This
sketch may be arranged the exact size of pattern needed, or it may be proportionally
larger or smaller. If the design is a reproduction from a woven fabric, a correct
duplicate on the regular drawing paper is required; for this sketch is of the same
value to the designer for Jacquard work as the correct picking out of a weave is to
the designer for harness loom-work.</p>

<p>In preparing an <i>original sketch</i>, the points to be considered are: <i>The setting
of the figure, and the most practical size</i>.</p>


<h3>Methods of Setting the Figures.</h3>

<p class="pclear">In setting figures in a sketch the appearance of “<i>streaks</i>” must be avoided.
To do this it will be found advantageous to sketch more than one repeat of the
pattern; if possible, sketch two each way, that the streaking, if any, may show itself
in the sketch, and be corrected there. Nearly all the patterns seen in fabrics which
show streaks can be traced to designers who prepare their designs without sketches;
for if a sketch had been made, the streaking of the fabric
might have been foreseen had the designer exercised
proper care in the examination and perfecting of his
sketch. Figures taken from plants, or from life, can be
set in the same manner as explained for Figs. <a href="#FIG69">69</a> to <a href="#FIG76">76</a>.
For example, <a href="#FIG77">Fig. 77</a>, the figure for design. <a href="#FIGXXIV">Fig. XXXIV.</a>,
p. 32, the latter being set after the method illustrated by
<a href="#FIG70">Fig. 70.</a></p>

<h3>Size of Sketch Required.</h3>

<p>This is regulated by the number of harness-cords in one repeat or division, the
method of tie-up employed, and the texture of the finished fabric. For example:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Take 400 harness-cords for one division. Texture of the fabric when finished 100/90.
Tie-up employed, straight-through. <i>Required</i>: The size of one repeat for the sketch.</p>

<p><i>Answer</i>: 400 ÷ 100 = 4 inches. The figures may be arranged in this sketch to
repeat one, two, three, four, or more times in the 4 inches thus available.</p>

<h3>Transferring of the Sketch to the Squared Designing Paper.</h3>

<p>Having obtained a perfect sketch of the design as it appears in the fabric, or as
it is desired to show, the outlines are transferred to the □ designing paper. This
always requires an enlargement of the design, and to accomplish this the sketch itself
must be ruled proportionally to the heavy squares found on the □ designing paper.
If these squares should be too small for the sketch, they may be enlarged by throwing
4, 9, or 12 of the “squares” into one large one; which is indicated by extra ruling off
with pencil upon the required heavy lines. In this case the sketch is ruled off
corresponding to these pencil lines. The transfer of the sketch to the required
□ designing paper is governed by rules already explained for the enlargement of a
design on the regular drawing paper. After the design is transferred to the □
designing paper it must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span> “<i>outlined in squares</i>.”</p>


<h3>Outlining in Squares.</h3>

<p>This consists in painting the small squares forming the outline of the figure as
called for by the outline of the drawing. Two methods are observed: One “<i>outlining
in squares” inside the “drawing outline;”</i> the other <i>“outlining in squares”
outside the “drawing outline.”</i></p>

<p>If painting outside the outline, no small squares are taken, in which the drawing
outline, taken from inside the figure, encloses more than one-half of their surfaces.
If painting the “outline in squares” <i>inside</i> the “drawing outline,” this rule is
reversed, thus no small square can be taken which is overrun by the drawing
outline more than one-half from the outside of the design. The most difficult part
of the outlining in squares is to obtain the nearest possible reproduction of the
drawing outline. If circles, curves, etc., are to be made, they must be reproduced as
nearly correct as possible; no bunches, cuts, etc., should disturb its symmetry.</p>

<p><a href="#FIG87">Fig. 87</a> shows the variations and methods to be resorted to in “outlining by
squares” the five circles, each of different size.</p>

<p><a href="#FIG88">Fig. 88</a> shows the formation of projected straight lines varying from a horizontal
to a vertical direction. The full changes by 8<sup>s</sup>, 7<sup>s</sup>, 6<sup>s</sup>, 5<sup>s</sup>, 4<sup>s</sup>, 3<sup>s</sup>, 2<sup>s</sup>, 1<sup>s</sup> are

3<sup>s</sup> taken alternately as shown by the shaded line. Another half change between 1<sup>s</sup>
and 2<sup>s</sup>, also represented by the shaded effect, shows the change to be a repetition of
the step 1, 1, 2. Between this last mentioned change and the regular 2<sup>s</sup> change,
we find the direction of a straight line as derived from a repetition of 2, 2, 1, indicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
by the [.] Below the regular change by 1<sup>s</sup> the straight line is formed by using 7
times 1 and once 2 repeated. Above the regular change by 1<sup>s</sup> as shown by the
black diagonal, these same changes will form straight lines running from 45° to 90°.</p>

<h3>Rules for “Outlining in Squares” Inside or Outside the Drawing Outline.</h3>

<p>The outlining in squares outside the drawing outline is observed in designs
having the figure produced by the filling. The outlining in squares inside the
drawing outline is observed in designs having the figure produced by the warp.
By reversing these two rules, the figure in the design would be changed from the
sketch, for if outlining in squares inside the drawing outline, using filling for figure,
the figure would be reduced proportionally to the reduction made or taken away by
the outline squares. Thus, also, if the warp formed the figure, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span> “outlining
being done in squares,” outside the drawing outline, the figure would increase
proportionally the size of the squared outline. These rules refer to painting the
squares for warp only. Some fabrics require also the painting of the filling
squares.</p>

<p>The foregoing explanation may be reduced to the following <i>Rule</i>: If the
figure is required to be in white, “outline by squares” outside the drawing outline;
if the figure is required to be painted, “outline by squares” inside the drawing
outline.</p>

<p>After the design is outlined by full small squares, either the figure or the ground
(as required, but generally the figure) is painted all over. The paint required for
this work has been previously described. It is only necessary to mention that it must
have body enough to be clearly visible, but not sufficient to obscure the black ruled
lines of the paper, which must show clearly through the paint. The weave, if
necessary, is next put on the required spots, either in white or black paint.</p>

<p class="pclear">The two-ply ingrain carpet can also be made upon a Jacquard loom, tied up for
double sections. [See <a href="#Page_48">Chapter VI., page 48.</a>] This is also extensively used in the
manufacture of upholstery fabrics; in fact, the latter mentioned method is almost
exclusively used in Europe.</p>

<p>In <a href="#FIG95">Fig. 95</a> the weave of the “shot-about” effect calls for two picks face, and two
picks back. An examination of this part of the draft shows that the warp-thread
represented by the light pick  <img class="scaled" src="images/1u3d.gif" width="36" height="34" alt="1up 3down" /> is to be raised, or has been raised in the
adjoining heavy pick <img class="scaled" src="images/3u1d.gif" width="25" height="35" alt="3up 1down" />; further, we find the two light picks separated by the
raising of a different warp-thread in each pick, which is also effected between the two
heavy picks by the lowering of another warp-thread. This places the ground-thread
below its corresponding figure or mate thread, or the figure thread below its
corresponding ground-thread.</p>

<p>If these mate threads introduced in succession are required to show side by
side, either on the face or the back of the fabric, these changes must be indicated
on the design by different colors. If such effects are to be introduced when using
the common ingrain Jacquard machine, the needles of the latter must be operated
at each pick; this requires twice as many cards as are used in designs where the
mate thread is always placed below or above its corresponding thread.</p>


<h3>Designs for Dressgoods Figured with Extra Warp (one end Ground, one end Figure),
and Executed on the Double Section Tie-up.</h3>

<p>In the article explaining the double section tie-up, [see <a href="#Page_48">Chapter VI., p. 48</a>], as
well as the one on the selection of the proper squared paper required for these
fabrics, the general character of these fabrics has been explained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>As mentioned in Chapter VI., the machine is divided in two parts, figure and
ground; the Jacquard harness is leased one end figure, one end ground, and
repeated.</p>

<img class="scaled" src="images/2u1d.gif" width="36" height="35" alt="2up 1down" /> twill,
<img class="scaled" src="images/2u2d.gif" width="36" height="34" alt="2up 2down" />  twill, or the four harness broken
twill, etc., without changing the figure design.]</p>


<h3>Designs for Figured Pile Fabrics.</h3>

<p>Designs for figured pile fabrics
(terry or velvet), Plushes, Astrakhans,
etc., are also executed without introducing
a weave in the design. The
design is only intended for the pile-threads,
which are raised when introducing
the wire; the front harness
operating the ground-warp. The pile-warp,
when raised over the wire, is
bound by means of the previous pick,
as well as by the pick following by the
filling to the ground cloth.</p>


<h3>The Shading of Textile Fabrics by the
Weave.</h3>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 99.</span>&mdash;Shading of Flowers in Sketches for Damask Fabrics.</div>
</div>

<p>This is generally done in the
“figure” part (especially in flowers,
leaves, etc.), of damasks and similar
textile fabrics. The shading can be
applied to the satin weaves to the
best advantage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Rule for Shading with Satin Weaves.</i></h3>

<p>Put the ground weave (filling for face) over the
entire part of the □ designing paper, which is required
to be shaded; afterwards add one, two, three or more
horizontal or vertical (connecting) spots to the one spot
which forms the foundation or satin filling for face. The
heaviness of the shade is regulated by the sketch or
the fabric. For example: In an 8-leaf satin the difference
between filling for face and warp for face may be
made with three or four changes only; or with the entire
seven changes.</p>

<p>For shading twill weaves no rule can be given.</p>

<p class="glossary"><b>Pile Fabrics</b> can have the pile produced either by the warp or the filling. If the pile has to be produced by the warp, a certain number of warp-threads are raised on certain picks over
wires. These elevated threads are interwoven in the pick preceding the interweaving of the wire, and also in the pick following it, with a filling-thread to the ground cloth. After a certain number of wires have been inserted, the first interwoven wire is drawn out of the fabric to be used over, which operation is repeated in rotation with every wire. We find terry and velvet piles. If the pile is produced by the filling, some or all filling-threads must float in certain places to allow the thread to be cut at this place, or its
 fibres to be raised during the process of finishing the fabric,<span class="in0right"><a href="#Page_53">53</a>, <a href="#Page_118">118</a></span></p>

<p class="glossary"><b>Reed</b>, a series of narrow strips of metal, between which the warp-threads pass in the loom. The purpose of the reed is to keep the warp evenly divided, also to strike the filling in many places at the beating the reed towards the breast-beam of the loom. The reed is known by numbers, the number in each case indicating how many splits are in one inch.
       Rule for ascertaining the <i>reed number</i>, if the number of ends in the warp and the width in the reed are known; the threads per dent either given or to be selected according to the fabric:&mdash;Divide the number of ends in the warp by the width in the reed, which gives the number of threads per inch; divide this result again by the number of threads in one dent, according to the weave or rows deep of comber-board. Whole numbers or half numbers are generally used for grading reeds only.</p>

<p class="glossary"><b>Satin-weaves</b> are characterized by a smooth face. The stitch of the threads is opposite to that of the twill weaves. The foundations for designing a satin-weave are, in the first place, to arrange as much as possible distributed stitching; in the second, to have this as regular as possible. The satin-weaves commence with the five-harness, and can after this be made on any number of harness.
         To find the run of stitching in the easiest way, use the following rule:  Divide the number of harness into two parts, which must neither be equal, nor the one a multiple of the other. Afterwards take one result and add it, commencing to count from 1 until all threads or harnesses are taken up, as example:  Five harness&mdash;5 = 2 + 3. Commencing with one and adding two points, we have as follows: 1 + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7, or 2 + 2 = 4. This will give the stitch as: 1, 3, 5, 2, 4, which means: the first pick stitches in the first warp-thread, the second pick stitches in the third warp-thread, the third pick stitches in the fifth warp-thread, the fourth pick
stitches in the second warp-thread, the fifth pick stitches in the fourth warp-thread.</p>

 <i>worsted</i> or <i>wool-spun</i> yarn. The size of the thread for worsted is calculated by
560 yards to 16 ounces for No. 1, and the same number of yards is added for each successive number
balanced by the original 16 ounces. For woolen yarn two methods of calculating the size are in use:
 The <i>Cut</i> system, having 300 yards to one cut (16 ounces); the <i>Run</i> system, having 1600
 yards to one run (16 ounces). The same number of yards are added to each successive number of cut or
run, also to be balanced by the original 16 ounces.</p>

<p class="adnotes">New High-speed Power Loom For Ingrain Carpets.
Built by The M. a. Furbush &amp; Son Machine Co., Philadelphia, Pa., U. S. A.
One Hundred Picks Per Minute. Fifteen Shuttles Pick and Pick.
This Loom combines the best features of the Duckworth and Murkland Looms;
while possessing the shading capacity of the latter, it is easier in its operation, and
of a considerably higher speed than either.
The following points as to the construction and operation of this Loom will
prove to any manufacturer, superintendent, fixer or weaver the superiority of the
same over any other style:
Runs light.There is no heavy lay to operate, as in other looms. The
lay (raceway and boxes) are stationary, and the filling is beaten up by means of a
comb, which is the only part that swings; being light, it can easily accomplish the
movements necessary for the one hundred picks per minute, which could never be
attained by operating the lay as in any other loom.
No tearing of cloth By the Shuttle Catching in the Warp and Being Drawn
Up by the Reed, as the comb for beating up the filling passes in front of the shuttle.
Easy on filling. The peculiar shape of the filling fork allows the shuttle to
pass under it, at the same time merely opening wide enough to admit the filling.
The motion is easy and delicate, and will not break the poorest filling&mdash;a great point
of superiority over all other high-speed looms, in which there is always more or less
tendency to chop the filling.
Shuttle boxes. The box mechanism is the same as in the Murkland Loom,
there being a revolver of seven boxes and three upright boxes, thus giving ten
boxes on each side, or twenty in all.
The Jacquard machine is constructed principally as in the Duckworth Loom,
although the cylinder gauge, boards and journals are like those of the Murkland.
The cylinder is worked with the rock shaft of the Duckworth Loom, instead of a
cam shaft.
The change gears For Take-up, instead of being worm gears, are ratchet;
but the number of teeth to number of picks is the same as in the Murkland.
Power back-off. The Loom has a power back-off, as in the Duckworth, a
pressure of the foot being sufficient to reverse the Loom.
Separate cams are provided for each arrangement of boxes, instead of segment
cams as in the Murkland Loom.
The Loom is pick and pick. Journals are operated from below by
cams and treadles.
The new Loom covers all the features demanded in a perfect Ingrain Carpet
Loom, including ability to make all the new weaves.</p>

<p class="adnotes">Knowles’ New Ingrain Power Carpet Loom.
Designed to meet a want long felt in the manufacture of Ingrain Carpets, for a loom that should be simple in its construction,
easy of operation, positive in its motions, and could be run at a high rate of speed.
The Knowles Loom Works take pleasure in calling the attention of carpet manufacturers to their new
Ingrain Carpet Loom, as one in which all the above features are combined in such a manner as to make a loom that
meets the requirements mentioned above, and one that will be highly appreciated by manufacturers of those goods for which
the loom is designed.
The following are among the important
features:
The journals on the loom are controlled
by a cam motion, or by the same
efficient chain motion that is used on our
Worsted Loom instead of the cam motion,
handling the warp with the greatest ease
and calling either journal at will, which
cannot be done on other carpet looms, thus
giving a wider range of pattern and design
than on other looms; and should it be
necessary to change the shading, it can be
done by changing the chain, instead of
cutting out the warp and re-drawing it.
The box mechanism is positive, and
controlled by a chain on the same shaft as
the journals, and may be used with the
chain alone, or with the chain in combination
with the cards. The motion can be
run forward or reversed at will, and any
box called as desired, thus giving a wide
range to the shading facilities of the loom,
and any combination of colors can be produced
on this loom that can be done on
any 4 × 4 box loom in the world.
The Jacquard is of our own manufacture,
and of the most improved pattern.
Great care is used in its construction, thus
making it a very efficient part of the loom,
and is driven from the same shaft as the
journals and box motion, thus working in
harmony with them.
The take-up motion is positive, and
is very substantial and accurate, consisting
of fluted rolls, and operated by the usual
train of gearing, while the goods are wound
up on a roll below.
The let-off is controlled by the tension
of the warp over a rocking whip roll,
operated by a cam on the bottom shaft, held by a clamp friction, geared to the head of the beam.
Two filling motions are used, one at each end of the lay, each working independently of the other, inside the selvedge,
so that the breakage of the weft is instantly detected, and these motions are so combined with friction pulley and brake,
that the loom is stopped instantly “on the pick,” and consequently, when filling is replaced, the loom is ready to start
without loss of time in finding the pick, or setting of Jacquard or box motion.
The shuttle-smash protector, which knocks off the loom when the shuttle does not box properly, thus preventing what
are known as “shuttle smashes;” a shuttle check, for easing the force of the shuttle as it enters the box; <i>a foot lever</i>, for
throwing the lay back when the loom is stopped, making it very easy for the weaver, and the speed at which the loom
can be run, together with the features mentioned above, combine to make this loom the best in the market for the
purpose for which it is designed.

desire to call particular attention to the facilities that are
offered for a practical instruction in <i>weaving and textile
design</i>. Special courses are provided for <i>teaching designing</i>
for all varieties of <i>textile fabrics</i>, and its <i>practical application
to loom work</i>. As a complete course in its theoretical and
practical utility we do not hesitate to say it <i>is without an
equal in America</i>. A school of this kind is of the highest
importance to the manufacturing community that centres
about Philadelphia.&mdash;<i>Boston Journal of Commerce.</i></p>

<p class="center">An American Textile School.

<p><i>The Textile Department</i> of the Pennsylvania Museum
and School of Industrial Art clearly fulfils the requirements
of a good Textile School, and the promise is that it will
speedily become one of the best in the world, as it is now
decidedly the most advanced in this country. Pupils are
taught <i>designing for all varieties of textile fabrics</i>, and to
make them <i>thoroughly familiar with loom work</i>, so that
they may be able not only to prepare their own designs, but
also to reproduce their own patterns in the cloth.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
